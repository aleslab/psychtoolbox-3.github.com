Enable the [TOUCHPixx](TOUCHPixx) touch panel hardware subsystem. The [TOUCHPixx](TOUCHPixx) is a 5-wire  
resistive touch panel. It is driven by a custom hardware controller designed by  
[VPixx](VPixx) Technologies. The controller polls the panel at more than 5kHz waiting for  
a panel press. If a press has been detected, its X,Y coordinates can be read  
with [GetTouchpixxCoordinates](GetTouchpixxCoordinates). If logging is enabled, a touch timetag is stored  
with the coordinates into a log buffer. If continuous logging is enabled,  
successive timetags and coordinates are logged at 200Hz. A final timetag and  
(0,0) coordinates are logged when the panel pressure is released.Note that the  
[TOUCHPixx](TOUCHPixx) subsystem uses some of the Digital Input resources. Specifically,  
[TOUCHPixx](TOUCHPixx) logging cannot be used simultaneously with digital input logging.  
See Touchpixx\*Demo files for examples.
