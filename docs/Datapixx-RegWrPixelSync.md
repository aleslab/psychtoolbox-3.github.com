# [Datapixx('RegWrPixelSync')](Datapixx-RegWrPixelSync) 
##### [Psychtoolbox](Pyschtoolbox)>[Datapixx](Datapixx).{mex*} subfunction


Write local register cache modifications to Datapixx when the specified pixel  
sequence appears on the video display. This is a good way to write Datapixx  
registers with microsecond synchronization to a specific location in a video  
frame. All Datapixx Set\* functions do fast writes to a local register cache on  
the host, and all Datapixx Get\* functions do fast reads from this local register  
cache. [RegWrPixelSync](RegWrPixelSync) writes these cached register modifications back to the  
Datapixx over USB. The cache writeback USB message is sent immediately and this  
function returns quickly, but the Datapixx itself waits until the specified  
pixel sequence is received before writing the registers.  
-pixelSequence is a two dimensional array of 8-bit pixel values. Each column  
contains the RGB values for one pixel in the sequence. The sequence can contain  
from 1 to 8 pixels. The array must contain 3 rows; one row for each of the red,  
green, and blue pixel components. For example, passing [255 0; 0 255; 0 0] would  
wait until a red-green pixel pair is displayed.  
Note that a display's gamma setting can transform pixel values between the frame  
buffer and the display. Use the [GetVideoLine](GetVideoLine) function to read back which pixel  
values are really sent to the display when a pixel sequence is drawn in the  
frame buffer. The pixel values returned by [GetVideoLine](GetVideoLine) are the values which  
should be used in pixelSequence.  
-timeout is the maximum number of video frames (0-65535) which the Datapixx  
should wait before continuing to process USB traffic. If the timeout is reached  
without the specified pixel sequence having been displayed, then the  
pixelSyncTimeout field returned by [GetVideoStatus](GetVideoStatus) will return true after the  
next [RegWrRd](RegWrRd)\* command.  
See [DatapixxDacSyncDemo](DatapixxDacSyncDemo).m for examples.
