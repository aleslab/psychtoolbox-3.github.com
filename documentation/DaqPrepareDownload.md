USB-1208FS: Prepare for program memory download. This command puts the  
device into code update mode.  The unlock code must be correct as a  
further safety device.  Call this once before sending code with  
[WriteCode](WriteCode).  If not in code update mode, any [WriteCode](WriteCode) commands will be  
ignored. The USB-1208FS firmware manual does not state how long the "code  
update mode" state persists, or how it can be turned back off. However, the   
[DaqGetStatus](DaqGetStatus) command does report this state.  
"[DeviceIndex](DeviceIndex)" is a small integer, the array index specifying which HID  
      device in the array returned by [PsychHID](PsychHID)('Devices') is interface 0  
      of the desired USB-1208FS box.

In my tests with a USB-1608FS, sending a report with anything other than the  
correct unlock code caused the device to exit program mode.  So I modified  
this function to allow user to toggle between states. If no second argument is  
passed, function assumes user wants to put device into program mode; else if  
second argument is zero device will be taken (or left) out of program mode.
