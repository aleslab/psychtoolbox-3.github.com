<p>kPsychUseTextureMatrixForRotation</p>
<p>Returns a constant to be passed as part of the ‘specialFlags’ parameter<br />
of the <a href="Screen" class="uri">Screen</a>(‘DrawTexture’) and <a href="Screen" class="uri">Screen</a>(‘DrawTextures’) command.</p>
<p>If this flag is set, the texture drawing functions will use the <a href="OpenGL" class="uri">OpenGL</a><br />
TEXTURE_MATRIX instead of the MODELVIEW_MATRIX for application of a<br />
rotation transform - ie. for rotated drawing of textures.</p>
<h3 id="conceptually-you-can-think-of-the-difference-as-follows">Conceptually you can think of the difference as follows:</h3>
<p>Normally, you pass a rectangular, upright ‘dstRect’ destination rectangle<br />
that defines the area of the window that should be overdrawn by the<br />
texture. If the ‘rotationAngle’ is non-zero, this ‘dstRect’ will be<br />
rotated around its center, thereby drawing a rotated texture onto the<br />
screen. The pixel data is read from the upright ‘srcRect’ source<br />
rectangle in the texture image matrix.</p>
<p>If you set this flag, then the destination rectangle ‘dstRect’ stays at<br />
its defined upright position, whereas the ‘srcRect’ rectangular source<br />
area is rotated by ‘rotationAngle’ around its center, so a rotated area<br />
of the texture image matrix is read out, but drawn upright into the<br />
window. The advantage of this mode is that you can draw a lot rotated<br />
textures tightly packed/close to other parts of your stimulus without<br />
interference.</p>
<p>If you use the 2nd mode of drawing, you’ll need to make sure that the<br />
‘srcRect’ source rectangle only occupies a fraction of the texture image<br />
and that you’ll have at least d * sqrt(2) pixels space of defined texture<br />
data around the center of the ‘srcRect’, when d is the maximum of the<br />
width and height of the rectangle. Otherwise the “rotated reading” from<br />
the texture would actually try to read from areas outside the texture<br />
matrix - this will create undefined visual results, but most likely not<br />
what you want.</p>
