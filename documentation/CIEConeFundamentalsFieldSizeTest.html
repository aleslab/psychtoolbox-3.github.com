<p>Look at how the quantities in the CIE standard that depend on field size vary with<br />
field size, particularly for field sizes greater than 10-degrees, which<br />
is the outer limit of what the standard sanctions.</p>
<p>My conclusions are<br />
1. that since we know macular pigment is declining towards zero with<br />
field size (see refs below) and the CIE expoential formula has this<br />
property, it is resonable to use the CIE formula for macular pigment<br />
density for field sizes greater than 10-degrees.<br />
2. the CIE formula for pigment optical density asymptotes to a constant<br />
as one extends past 10-degrees. Whether this is true in the retina or<br />
not, I am not sure. But as field size gets larger, using this formula<br />
is going to be no worse than simply using the 10-degree values, since<br />
they are the same.<br />
3. one needs to take any estimate of the <a href="CMFs" class="uri">CMFs</a> for large field sizes<br />
with a grain of salt. There is going to be variation across the field,<br />
so any point estimate is likely to be wrong somewhere. The CIE<br />
formulae, extended using the formulae past their bounds, are a good<br />
first guess for the mean field properties, but being aware that there<br />
is variation within the field, as well as individual variation around<br />
the CIE estimates, is important when considering things like the effect<br />
of inadvertant stimulation of cones when one tries to isolate<br />
melanopsin using silent substitution. Note in particular that the CIE<br />
formula is trying to capture large field color matches where subjects<br />
are instructed to ignore the center of the field as best they can. In<br />
a threshold experiment, this might not be how subjects were instructed<br />
and would in any case be rather hard to do. And if you used annular<br />
stimuli, you’d be a bit off and might want to think about how to<br />
estimate the fundamentals from the annulus. Studying the Moreland and<br />
Alexander paper below in detail might help with thinking on that.</p>

Moreland and Alexander make color matches for annuli and for<br />
circular fields, and develop a formula for the equivalent macular<br />
pigment density for color matches of various field sizes. In<br />
these matches, observers are instructed to to ignore the central<br />
Maxwell?s spot, I am pretty sure. M&amp;A say the data are consistent<br />
with the idea that obsevers look near the edge of the field but<br />
not quite at it. Their data are for field sizes of 10 degrees,<br />
and the estimates are fit with exponentials. M&amp;A used these data<br />
together with measurements of macular pigment density by Moreland<br />
&amp; Bhatt (1884) to develop an equivalent (for uniform fields)<br />
macular pigment density to be used in predicting color matches<br />
out to 10 degrees. The formula is an exponential decay.<br />
Something like this made it into the CIE standard, although it<br />
may have been tweaked to make sure the color matching data are<br />
consistent with the 10-deg and 2-deg <a href="CMFs" class="uri">CMFs</a>. I have not thought<br />
hard about the underlying calculations.</p>

Uses color-matching data for field sizes out to 18 deg (I think)<br />
to develop estimates of macular pigment density as a function of<br />
eccentricity. Key feature of the data is that density estimates<br />
decline according to an exponential and reach zero at<br />
eccentricity (radius) of about 7 degrees. This paper also<br />
reviews earlier estimates and they all look like decaying<br />
exponentials.</p>
