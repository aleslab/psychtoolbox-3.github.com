<p><a href="FastNoiseDemo" class="uri">FastNoiseDemo</a>([numRects=1][, rectSize=128][, scale=1][, syncToVBL=1][, dontclear=0])</p>
<p>Demonstrates how to generate and draw noise patches on-the-fly in a fast way. Can be<br />
used to benchmark your system by varying the load. If you like this demo<br />
then also have a look at <a href="FastMaskedNoiseDemo" class="uri">FastMaskedNoiseDemo</a> that shows how to<br />
efficiently draw a masked stimulus by use of alpha-blending.</p>
<p>numRects = Number of random patches to generate and draw per frame.</p>
<p>rectSize = Size of the generated random noise image: rectSize by rectSize<br />
pixels. This is also the size of the Psychtoolbox noise<br />
texture.</p>
<p>scale = Scalefactor to apply to texture during drawing: E.g. if you’d set<br />
scale = 2, then each noise pixel would be replicated to draw an image<br />
that is twice the width and height of the input noise image. In this<br />
demo, a nearest neighbour filter is applied, i.e., pixels are just<br />
replicated, not bilinearly filtered – Important to preserve statistical<br />
independence of the random pixel values!</p>
<p>syncToVBL = 1=Synchronize bufferswaps to retrace. 0=Swap immediately when<br />
drawing is finished. Value zero is useful for benchmarking the whole<br />
system, because your measured framerate will not be limited by the<br />
monitor refresh rate – Gives you a feeling of how much headroom is left<br />
in your loop.</p>
<p>dontclear = If set to 1 then the backbuffer is not automatically cleared<br />
to background color after a flip. Can save up to 1 millisecond on old<br />
graphics hardware.</p>

<a href="GeForce" class="uri">GeForce</a> 7800 GTX graphics card, running under M$-Windows XP SP3:</p>
<p>Two patches, 256 by 256 noise pixels each, scaled by any factor between 1<br />
and 5 yields a redraw rate of 100 Hz.</p>
<p>One patch, 256 by 256 noise pixels, scaled by any factor between 1<br />
and 5 yields a redraw rate of 196 Hz.</p>
<p>Two patches, 128 by 128 noise pixels each, scaled by any factor between 1<br />
and 5 yields a redraw rate of 360 - 380 Hz.</p>
<p>One patch, 128 by 128 noise pixels, scaled by any factor between 1<br />
and 5 yields a redraw rate of 670 Hz.</p>
