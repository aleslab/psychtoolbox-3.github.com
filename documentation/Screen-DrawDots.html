<p>Quickly draw an array of dots. “xy” is a two-row vector containing the x and y<br />
coordinates of the dot centers, relative to “center” (default center is [0 0]).<br />
“size” is the diameter of each dot in pixels (default is 1). Instead of a common<br />
size for all dots you can also provide a vector which defines a different dot<br />
size for each dot. Different graphics cards do have different limits on the<br />
maximum size of dots, 10 or 63 are typical limits.<br />
“color” is the the clut index (scalar or [r g b a] vector) that you want to poke<br />
into each dot pixel (default is black). Instead of a single “color” you can<br />
also provide a 3 or 4 row vector,which specifies an individual RGB or RGBA color<br />
for each corresponding point.<br />
“dot_type” is a flag that determines what type of dot is drawn: 0 (default) and<br />
4 draw square dots, whereas 1, 2 and 3 draw round dots (circles) with<br />
anti-aliasing: 1 favors performance, 2 tries to use high-quality anti-aliasing,<br />
if supported by your hardware. 3 Uses a builtin shader-based implementation.<br />
dot_type 1 and 2 may not be supported by all graphics cards and drivers. On some<br />
systems <a href="Screen" class="uri">Screen</a>() will then automatically switch to dot_type 3 - our own<br />
implementation - in such a case. If you use round dot_type 1, 2 or 3 you’ll also<br />
need to set a proper blending mode with the <a href="Screen" class="uri">Screen</a>(‘BlendFunction’) command,<br />
e.g., GL_SRC_ALPHA + GL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA. A dot_type of 4 will draw square<br />
dots like dot_type 0, but may be faster when drawing lots of dots of different<br />
sizes by use of an efficient shader based path.<br />
“lenient” If set to 1, will not check the sizes of dots for validity, so you can<br />
try requesting sizes bigger than what the hardware claims to support.</p>
<p>The optional return arguments [minSmoothPointSize, maxSmoothPointSize,<br />
minAliasedPointSize, maxAliasedPointSize] allow you to query the minimum and<br />
maximum allowed ‘size’ for smooth anti-aliased dots (dot_type 1,2,3) and for non<br />
anti-aliased square dots (dot_type 0 and 4). Calling […] = <a href="Screen" class="uri">Screen</a>(‘DrawDots’,<br />
windowPtr) will only query these point size limits without drawing any dots.</p>
