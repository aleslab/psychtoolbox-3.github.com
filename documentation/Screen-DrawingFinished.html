<p>Tell Psychtoolbox that no further drawing commands will be issued to ‘windowPtr’<br />
before the next <a href="Screen" class="uri">Screen</a>(‘<a href="Flip" class="uri">Flip</a>’) or <a href="Screen" class="uri">Screen</a>(‘AsyncFlipBegin’) command.</p>
<p>This is a hint that allows to optimize drawing performance on some occasions.<br />
Don’t issue this command multiple times between a <a href="Flip" class="uri">Flip</a>, it will degrade<br />
performance or even cause undefined stimulus display!</p>
<p>You must provide the same value for ‘dontclear’ flag that you’re going to pass<br />
to the following <a href="Flip" class="uri">Flip</a> command, if you pass such an optional flag to the <a href="Flip" class="uri">Flip</a><br />
command.</p>
<p>You can time the execution of all drawing commands between the most recent <a href="Flip" class="uri">Flip</a><br />
and this command by setting the optional flag sync=1. In that case, telapsed is<br />
the elapsed time at drawing completion. Don’t set the sync - Flag for real<br />
experiments, it will degrade performance!</p>
<p>Some recent graphics cards provide a more fine-grained way to measure the time<br />
spent drawing and processing your stimulus. See the help of ‘<a href="Screen" class="uri">Screen</a><br />
<a href="GetWindowInfo" class="uri">GetWindowInfo</a>?’ about ‘infoType’ settings 5 and 6 on how to use that mechanism.<br />
That method also has the advantage of measuring precise without degrading<br />
overall performance.</p>
