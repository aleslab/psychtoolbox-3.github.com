<h2 id="psychtoolbox-datapixx.mexdll-subfunction">[[Psychtoolbox]] › [[Datapixx]].{mex*,dll} subfunction</h2>
<p>Returns a struct containing the following ADC status information:<br />
-“dacAdcLoopback” is 1 if ADC inputs are driven internally by DAC outputs, or 0<br />
if ADC inputs report real analog inputs.<br />
-“freeRunning” is 1 if ADC hardware is sampling continuously, or 0 if it only<br />
samples on ADC acquisition schedule ticks.<br />
-“scheduleRunning” is 1 if the analog acquisition schedule is currently running,<br />
or 0 if stopped.<br />
-“scheduleOnset” is the programmed delay in seconds between <a href="StartAdcSchedule" class="uri">StartAdcSchedule</a><br />
execution, and the first ADC sample acquisition.<br />
-“scheduleRate” is the rate at which subsequent ADC samples are acquired.<br />
-“scheduleRateUnits” is the programmed units of scheduleRate:<br />
1: samples per second<br />
2: samples per video frame<br />
3: seconds per sample<br />
-“numChannels” is the number of ADC channels scheduled for acquisition.<br />
-“chanSelString” is a string with one selection status character per ADC<br />
channel. If the channel is not scheduled, the character is ‘-’; otherwise, the<br />
status character is the channel number (eg: ‘01234567——–’ means that<br />
channels 0 to 7 are stored in the acquisition buffer, but channels 8-15 are<br />
not).<br />
-“chanRefString” is a string with one reference status character per ADC<br />
channel:<br />
‘-’: single ended, referenced to ground<br />
‘D’: fully differential, referenced to adjacent channel<br />
‘0’: differential, referenced to REF0<br />
‘1’: differential, referenced to REF1<br />
-“bufferBaseAddress” is the acquisition data buffer base address within the<br />
Datapixx.<br />
-“bufferSize” is the number of bytes in the acquisition data buffer.<br />
-“numBufferFrames” is the total number of samples which fit in the acquisition<br />
data buffer.<br />
-“currentWriteFrame” is the buffer frame which will be written by the next<br />
acquired ADC sample.<br />
-“currentReadFrame” is the buffer frame which will be read by the next streaming<br />
call to <a href="ReadAdcBuffer" class="uri">ReadAdcBuffer</a>.<br />
-“newBufferFrames” = currentWriteFrame - currentReadFrame. This is the maximum<br />
number of frames which can be read by the next call to <a href="ReadAdcBuffer" class="uri">ReadAdcBuffer</a> in<br />
streaming mode, without causing a streaming underflow.<br />
-“maxScheduleFrames”, if non-0, is the value of currentWriteFrame which will<br />
automatically stop the schedule.<br />
-“numStreamUnderflows” is the number of <a href="ReadAdcBuffer" class="uri">ReadAdcBuffer</a> streaming underflows which<br />
have occurred since <a href="SetAdcSchedule" class="uri">SetAdcSchedule</a>. See <a href="ReadAdcBuffer" class="uri">ReadAdcBuffer</a> for details.<br />
-“numStreamOverflows” is the number of <a href="ReadAdcBuffer" class="uri">ReadAdcBuffer</a> streaming overflows which<br />
have occurred since <a href="SetAdcSchedule" class="uri">SetAdcSchedule</a>. See <a href="ReadAdcBuffer" class="uri">ReadAdcBuffer</a> for details.<br />
