<p><a href="FrameSequentialStereoTest" class="uri">FrameSequentialStereoTest</a>(screenid)</p>
<p>Tests presentation order and timing of stimulus onset in frame sequential<br />
stereo mode. This is a perceptual test.</p>
<p>The test will run on the screen with the highest number by default, but<br />
you can pass a ‘screenid’ to it, if you want.</p>
<p>After startup, the display will show a mostly constant yellow, red or<br />
green display. Depending on what you see, it tells you how your graphics<br />
hardware syncs buffer onset:</p>
<ol type="A">
<li><p>If you see a constant yellow screen, then your hardware always makes sure<br />
that a full stereo cycle is presented before executing a <a href="Screen" class="uri">Screen</a>(‘flip’)<br />
command, however its not defined if onset of a new stimulus will happen<br />
with the left buffer first or with the right buffer. You’d need<br />
measurement equipment to verify which is the startbuffer. The granularity<br />
of buffer swaps will be reduced to the duration of two video refresh<br />
intervals, as indicated by the ‘ifi’ number printed to the Matlab window.</p></li>
<li><p>If you see either a constant green or a constant red at each run of the<br />
script (always red or always green, never anything else), then your<br />
hardware will sync bufferswaps always to the onset of the left stereo<br />
buffer (if you see red) or to the right buffer (if you see green).</p></li>
<li><p>If you see either a constant green or a constant red during one run of the<br />
script, but you observe different colors at repeated runs of the script,<br />
or a slow switching between red and green, then that means that your<br />
hardware doesn’t care about syncing bufferswaps to a fixed buffer,<br />
instead it just swaps at the next VBL, so either the left- or the right-<br />
stereo buffer of a new stimulus will show first. The maximum flip rate is<br />
equal to the monitor refresh rate.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In case C) you are out of luck if you use Microsoft Windows. If you use<br />
Linux, then contact the forum with a feature request, we may implement a<br />
solution for you. If you run <a href="MacOS" class="uri">MacOS</a>/X, you can ‘force’ the graphics<br />
hardware to always synchronize stimulus onset (flip) to either the left-<br />
or the right buffers display cycle, and you can query which buffer was<br />
displayed first after flip, left- or right. However this is a software<br />
trick which needs calibration. To test if the trick works on your setup,<br />
do the following:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Wait until color of the display settles to either red or green.<br />
</li>
<li>If its green, press the ‘g’ key, if its red, press the ‘r’ key.<br />
</li>
<li>After a short period, the display should settle to a nice green,<br />
indicating that the trick works, and PTB should write ‘GREEN’ to the<br />
Matlab window.<br />
</li>
<li>If the display doesn’t stabilize to green, but at least the output of<br />
the Matlab window corresponds with your percept (GREEN for green, RED for<br />
red) then that means that your system has very noisy timing.</li>
