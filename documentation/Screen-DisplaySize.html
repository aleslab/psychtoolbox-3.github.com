<p>Return the physical width and height of the output display device associated<br />
with ‘ScreenNumber’. The size is returned in units of millimeters as reported by<br />
the display device itself to the OS. On <a href="MacOS" class="uri">MacOS</a>-X, if Extended Display<br />
Identification Data (EDID) for the display device is not available, the size is<br />
estimated by OS-X based on the device width and height in pixels, with an<br />
assumed resolution of 2.835 pixels/mm or 72 DPI, a reasonable guess for displays<br />
predating EDID support. On M$-Windows and GNU/Linux, the behaviour in case of<br />
missing EDID data is unknown. This function returns a width and height of zero<br />
if physical display size can’t be queried from the operating system. Please<br />
handle the returned information with great caution. It is unclear how accurate<br />
the EDID data for typical monitors or video beamers really is. This information<br />
could be pretty unreliable and therefore misleading!</p>
