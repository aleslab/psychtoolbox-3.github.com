<p>Query or change display settings for screen “screenNumber”.<br />
Returns a struct “oldResolutions” with the current settings for screen<br />
resolution, refresh rate and pixel depth. Optionally sets new settings for<br />
screen resolution “newwidth” x “newheight”, refresh rate “newHz” and framebuffer<br />
pixel depth “newPixelSize”. Providing invalid or incompatible settings will<br />
raise an error. Especially the color depth “newPixelSize” should usually not be<br />
set to anything else than its default of 32 bpp or 24 bpp. Other settings can<br />
impair alpha-blending on some systems, a setting of 16 bpp will disable<br />
alpha-blending and create drastically reduced color resolution of 5 bits per<br />
color channel. A setting of 8 bpp is not supported at all on <a href="MacOS" class="uri">MacOS</a>/X and will<br />
create artifacts on all other systems. Use a size of 32 bpp even for clut<br />
animation. This function may not work on all MS-Windows setups, your mileage may<br />
vary…<br />
On Linux the function only switches display settings in the conventional sense<br />
on a single-display setup. On a multi-display setup, this function only changes<br />
the total size of the framebuffer, ie., ‘newwidth’ and ‘newheight’, the other<br />
parameters are silently ignored. On Linux, the video settings of each individual<br />
display, e.g., resolution, video refresh rate, panning, are queried and changed<br />
via the <a href="Screen" class="uri">Screen</a>(‘ConfigureDisplay’) function instead. This allows for much more<br />
flexibility, e.g., you can have a framebuffer bigger than the combined<br />
resolution of all displays and only show a fraction of it. You can change the<br />
relative position of all physical displays, configure “mirror modes”, “side by<br />
side”, or “on top of each other” display configurations.<br />
Psychtoolbox will automatically restore the systems display resolution to the<br />
system settings made via the display control panel as soon as either your script<br />
finishes by closing all its windows, or by some error. Terminating Matlab due to<br />
quit command will also restore the system preference settings. On a<br />
multi-display Linux setup, display settings are never automatically restored.<br />
If you call this command without ever opening onscreen windows and closing them<br />
at some point, Psychtoolbox will not restore display settings automatically.<br />
You can query a list of all supported combinations of display settings via the<br />
<a href="Screen" class="uri">Screen</a>(‘Resolutions’) command. “specialMode” is a flag you must not touch,<br />
unless you really know what you’re doing, that’s why we don’t tell you its<br />
purpose.</p>
