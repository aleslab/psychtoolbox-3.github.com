<p>Write local register cache modifications to Datapixx when the specified pixel<br />
sequence appears on the video display, then read back Datapixx register snapshot<br />
to local cache. This is a good way to write Datapixx registers with microsecond<br />
synchronization to a specific location in a video frame, then pause program<br />
execution until after the pixel has passed. All Datapixx Set* functions do fast<br />
writes to a local register cache on the host, and all Datapixx Get* functions do<br />
fast reads from this local register cache. <a href="RegWrRdPixelSync" class="uri">RegWrRdPixelSync</a> writes these cached<br />
register modifications back to the Datapixx over USB, then waits for a fresh<br />
snapshot of the Datapixx registers to be returned over USB. The cache writeback<br />
USB message is sent immediately, but the Datapixx itself waits until the<br />
specified pixel sequence is presented before writing the registers.<br />
-pixelSequence is a two dimensional array of 8-bit pixel values. Each column<br />
contains the RGB values for one pixel in the sequence. The sequence can contain<br />
from 1 to 8 pixels. The array must contain 3 rows; one row for each of the red,<br />
green, and blue pixel components. For example, passing [255 0; 0 255; 0 0] would<br />
wait until a red-green pixel pair is displayed.<br />
Note that a display’s gamma setting can transform pixel values between the frame<br />
buffer and the display. Use the <a href="GetVideoLine" class="uri">GetVideoLine</a> function to read back which pixel<br />
values are really sent to the display when a pixel sequence is drawn in the<br />
frame buffer. The pixel values returned by <a href="GetVideoLine" class="uri">GetVideoLine</a> are the values which<br />
should be used in pixelSequence.<br />
-timeout is the maximum number of video frames (0-65535) which the Datapixx<br />
should wait before continuing to process USB traffic. If the timeout is reached<br />
without the specified pixel sequence having been displayed, then the isTimeout<br />
return value will be true, and the pixelSyncTimeout field returned by<br />
<a href="GetVideoStatus" class="uri">GetVideoStatus</a> will be true.<br />
<a href="RegWrRdPixelSync" class="uri">RegWrRdPixelSync</a> returns when registers are read back after the target pixel<br />
sequence has passed, or a timeout occurs.</p>
