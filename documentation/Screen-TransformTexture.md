# [Screen('TransformTexture')](Screen-TransformTexture) 
## [[Psychtoolbox]] &#8250; [[Screen]].{mex*,dll} subfunction


Apply an image processing operation to a texture 'sourceTexture' and store the  
processed result either in 'targetTexture' if provided, or in a new texture (if  
'targetTexture' is not provided). Use the data in the optional 'sourceTexture2'  
as well if provided. This could be, e.g., a lookup table or a 2nd image for  
stereo processing. Return a handle 'transtexid' to the processed texture.  
The image processing operation is defined in the processing hook chain  
'UserDefinedBlit' of the proxy object 'transformProxyPtr'. 'specialFlags'  
optional flags to alter operation of this function:  
kPsychAssumeTextureNormalized - Assume source texture(s) are already in a  
normalized upright orientation. This can speed up processing, but it can lead to  
wrong results if the textures are not normalized and the imaging operation is  
non-isotropic - Use with care. A setting of specialFlags == 2 will ask to create  
or set the resulting 'transtexid' texture for high-precision drawing, see same  
setting in [Screen](Screen)('MakeTexture') for explanation. Read 'help  
PsychGLImageProcessing' for more infos on how to use this function.
