<p>Basic test and demo of the sound recording/capture functionality of the<br />
new <a href="PsychSound" class="uri">PsychSound</a>() function.</p>
<p>Parameters: duration = Recordingcapacity (in seconds) of the sound capture<br />
buffer. After recording of sound has been started, <a href="PsychSound" class="uri">PsychSound</a> will<br />
perform continuous recording into an internal ring-buffer with a storage capacity<br />
of ‘duration’ seconds, until recording gets stopped again. Soundrecording<br />
is done asynchronously as an automatic background process, independent of<br />
Matlabs/Psychtoolboxs execution. This way you can continue execution of<br />
your Matlab script (sound output, response collection, visual output,<br />
…) while <a href="PsychSound" class="uri">PsychSound</a> is recording in the background. You can query the<br />
amount of new recorded sound data in the buffer and you can fetch this<br />
data from the buffer into a Matlab matrix at any time during of after<br />
recording. Be aware though that if the buffers capacity is exhausted, it<br />
will dispose old sound data to store new one - only the last ‘duration’<br />
seconds of the most recently recorded sound are kept.</p>
<h3 id="this-leaves-you-with-two-options">This leaves you with two options:</h3>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Request a buffer big enough to store the full duration of your<br />
recording from Start of capture until the end, and read out the recorded<br />
data into a Matlab matrix after the end of the recording. This is the<br />
most easy to implement (nice linear control flow Start-&gt;Stop-&gt;Fetch), but<br />
you have to know the maximum duration in advance, and you’ll potentially<br />
use up significant amounts of memory.</p></li>
<li><p>Request a buffer big enough to hold sound data for at least the<br />
duration of one iteration of your trial loop. During each iteration, poll<br />
and fetch portions of the recording into your Matlab matrix. More<br />
involved programming, but low memory consumption.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>With b) you can obviously also implement an audio recorder for infinite<br />
capture into a file via while(1) Waitabit; Poll&amp;Fetch bit of sound data<br />
from <a href="PsychSound" class="uri">PsychSound</a> into Matrix; Append content of matrix to a file; end;</p>
<p>And you can do live capture, manipulation &amp; analysis of sound, e.g.,<br />
voice triggers, feedback of recorded sound to sound output and such.</p>
