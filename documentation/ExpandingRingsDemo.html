<p><a href="ExpandingRingsDemo" class="uri">ExpandingRingsDemo</a>([ringtype=0]) – Generate an “expanding rings”<br />
stimulus by use of GLSL shaders and Psychtoolbox procedural textures.</p>
<p>This demo illustrates the use of “procedural textures” with Psychtoolbox.<br />
A procedural texture is a texture that is not directly represented by an<br />
image matrix in memory, but the image content of the texture is generated<br />
on the fly during drawing of the texture by means of a small algorithm -<br />
a shader. The shader implements some mathematical formula or model which<br />
is evaluated to generate image content, or it reads content of a data<br />
matrix and transforms it into a picture. Psychtoolbox supports both,<br />
purely virtual textures of unlimited size that are purely algorithmically<br />
generated, and hybrid textures where an algorithm transforms the textures<br />
content into something to be drawn.</p>
<p>The algorithm has to be implemented by a GLSL shader program - a vertex<br />
shader, geometry shader, fragment shader or any combination of them. The<br />
shader program is read from a file, compiled and then attached to the<br />
texture at texture creation time. Procedural textures only work with<br />
graphics hardware that has sufficiently advanced support for (at least)<br />
hardware fragment shaders.</p>
<p>This demo implements a procedural texture which shows a set of rings that<br />
can expand and move. The shader gets attached to a purely virtual<br />
texture. The texture is drawn via the standard <a href="Screen" class="uri">Screen</a>(‘DrawTexture’)<br />
command – your graphics processor generates the image content of the<br />
stimulus on the fly during drawing of the texture via execution of the<br />
shader at each output pixel location.</p>
<p>The optional ‘ringtype’ parameter allows to select between different ring<br />
shapes. Default type is zero:</p>
<p>0 = Hard transitions between red and yellow rings.<br />
1 = Transitions are modeled as a smooth sine wave, softly fading from<br />
yellow to red and back.</p>
