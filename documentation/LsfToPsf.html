<p><a href="LSFToPSF" class="uri">LSFToPSF</a> Convert a line spread function to a point spread function.<br />
psf = LSFTOPSF(lsf,varargin)</p>
<p>This works by taking the lsf into the one-dimensional frequency domain<br />
(i.e. get the 1D MTF) and then creating a circularly symmetric version<br />
of this. The 2D frequency representation is then converted back to the<br />
spatial domain to produce the psf. This produces a spatially-symmetric<br />
PSF consistent with the measured line spread function.</p>
<p>This method is described by Marchand, 1964, JOSA, 54, 7, pp. 915-919<br />
and is one of several methods provided. In 1964, taking the Fourier<br />
transform was computationally intense.</p>
<p>There is a second paper by Marchand (1965, JOSA, 55, 4, 352-354) which<br />
treats the more general case where you have line spread functions for<br />
many orientations and want to recover an psf that is not necessarily<br />
spatially-symmetric.</p>
<p>The lsf must be spatially symmetric. This makes sense given that we<br />
are going to recover a spatially symmetric psf.</p>
<p>You want to make sure that the spatial suport is large enough to<br />
capture the full lsf.</p>
<p>The returned psf is normalized to have unit volume.</p>
