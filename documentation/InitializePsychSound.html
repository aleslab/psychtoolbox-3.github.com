<p><a href="InitializePsychSound" class="uri">InitializePsychSound</a>([reallyneedlowlatency=0])</p>
<p>This routine loads the <a href="PsychPortAudio" class="uri">PsychPortAudio</a> sound driver for high-precision,<br />
low-latency, multi-channel sound playback and recording.</p>
<p>Call it at the beginning of your experiment script, optionally providing<br />
the ‘reallyneedlowlatency’ flag set to one to push really hard for low<br />
latency.</p>
<p>On <a href="MacOS" class="uri">MacOS</a>/X and GNU/Linux, the <a href="PsychPortAudio" class="uri">PsychPortAudio</a> driver will just work with<br />
the lowest possible latency and highest timing precision after this<br />
initialization.</p>
<h3 id="on-microsoft-windows-things-are-more-complicated-and-painful-as-always">On Microsoft Windows, things are more complicated and painful as always:</h3>
<p><a href="PsychPortAudio" class="uri">PsychPortAudio</a> on Windows supports three different Windows sound systems,<br />
MME, <a href="DirectSound" class="uri">DirectSound</a> and ASIO. Only ASIO is suitable for research grade<br />
auditory stimulation with support for multi-channel sound cards and for<br />
high-precision and low-latency sound timing and time-stamping. If you<br />
want reliable timing and time-stamping with latencies and accuracy better<br />
than 500 msecs, you *must* have a decent ASIO sound card with proper<br />
vendor supplied ASIO drivers installed in your computer. A regular card,<br />
for example built-in sound chips of your computer, will not suffice and<br />
we will not guarantee any reasonable timing precision at all!</p>
<p>The Windows MME <a href="(MultiMediaExtensions)" class="uri">(MultiMediaExtensions)</a> sound system has typical latencies<br />
and inaccuracies in excess of 500 msecs, and the slightly better<br />
<a href="DirectSound" class="uri">DirectSound</a> sound system still has a typical latency of over 30<br />
milliseconds. Both systems are known to be buggy and unreliable wrt.<br />
timing on many systems.</p>
<p>The ASIO sound system provided by professional class sound cards usually<br />
has excellent timing precision and latencies below 15 msecs, often as low<br />
as 5 msecs for pro hardware. If you need really low latency or high<br />
precision sound on Windows, ASIO is what you must use: Some (usually more<br />
expensive) professional class sound cards ship with ASIO enabled sound<br />
drivers, or at least there’s such a driver available from the support<br />
area of the website of your sound card vendor.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: “ASIO is a trademark and software of Steinberg Media<br />
Technologies <a href="GmbH" class="uri">GmbH</a>.”</p>
<p>For cards without native ASIO drivers, there’s the free ASIO4ALL driver,<br />
downloadable from http://asio4all.com, which may or may not work well on<br />
your specific sound card - The driver emulates the ASIO interface on top<br />
of the WDM-KS (Windows Driver Model Kernel Streaming) API from Microsoft,<br />
so the quality depends on the underlying WDM driver. For research grade<br />
use, please do yourself a favor and invest in a real ASIO card.</p>
<p>If you manage to get such an ASIO enabled sound driver working on your<br />
sound hardware, and your ASIO enabled driver and sound card are of<br />
sufficiently high quality, you can enjoy latencies as low as 5 msecs and<br />
a sound onset accuracy with a standard deviation from the mean of less<br />
than 0.1 milliseconds on MS-Windows - We measured around 20 microseconds<br />
on some setups, e.g., the M-Audio Delta 1010-LT soundcard under<br />
Windows-XP SP2.</p>
<p>Using OS/X or Linux will usually get you comparably good or better<br />
results with most standard sound hardware, due to the technically<br />
superior sound systems of these operating systems.</p>
