<p>Return current state of head position and orientation tracking for Oculus device<br />
‘oculusPtr’.<br />
Head position and orientation is predicted for target time ‘predictionTime’ in<br />
seconds if provided, based on the latest measurements from the tracking<br />
hardware. If ‘predictionTime’ is omitted or set to zero, then no prediction is<br />
performed and the current state based on latest measurements is returned.</p>
<p>‘state’ is a struct with fields reporting the following values:<br />
‘Time’ = Time in seconds of predicted tracking state.<br />
‘Status’ = Tracking status flags. +1 = Head orientation tracked, +2 = Head<br />
position tracked, +4 = Camera pose tracked +32 = Position tracking hardware<br />
connected, +128 = HMD display is connected and available.<br />
‘HeadPose’ = Head position [x, y, z] in meters and rotation as quaternion [rx,<br />
ry, rz, rw], all as a vector [x,y,z,rx,ry,rz,rw].<br />
‘HeadLinearSpeed’ = Linear velocity [vx,vy,vz] in meters/sec.<br />
‘HeadAngularSpeed’ = Angular velocity [rx,ry,rz] in radians/sec.<br />
‘HeadLinearAcceleration’ = Linear acceleration [ax,ay,az] in meters/sec^2.<br />
‘HeadAngularAcceleration’ = Angular acceleration [rax,ray,raz] in radians/sec^2.<br />
‘CameraPose’ as vector with position and orientation quaternion, like<br />
‘HeadPose’.<br />
‘LeveledCameraPose’ Like ‘CameraPose’ but aligned to the gravity vector of the<br />
world.<br />
‘CameraFrustumHVFov’ Horizontal and vertical field of view of the tracking<br />
camera in radians.<br />
‘CameraFrustumNearFarZInMeters’ Near and far limit of the camera view frustum in<br />
meters.<br />
‘LastCameraFrameCounter’ Last camera framecounter value of tracking camera.<br />
‘RawSensorAcceleration’ = Raw measured accelerometer reading in m/sec^2.<br />
‘RawSensorGyroRate’ = Raw gyrometer reading in rad/s.<br />
‘RawMagnetometer’ = Raw magnetic field in gauss.<br />
‘SensorTemperature’ = Sensor temperature in degrees Celsius.<br />
‘IMUReadoutTime’ = Readout time of the last IMU sample in seconds.</p>
