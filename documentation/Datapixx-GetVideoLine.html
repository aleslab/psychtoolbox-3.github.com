<h2 id="psychtoolbox-datapixx.mexdll-subfunction">[[Psychtoolbox]] › [[Datapixx]].{mex*,dll} subfunction</h2>
<p>Upload pixels from Datapixx internal video receiver line buffer to local host.<br />
The pixels uploaded are from the start of the top raster line of the most recent<br />
video frame.<br />
-“nPixels” specifies the number of pixels to be uploaded. The default value is<br />
the horizontal resolution of the display. If nPixels is greater than the<br />
horizontal resolution of the display, then the returned pixels will include the<br />
digital video data received during the horizontal blanking interval, and<br />
possibly into the next raster line. The maximum number of pixels which can be<br />
requested is 2048.<br />
-“pixels” is returned as a 2D array with one column for each pixel, and one row<br />
for each of the red/green/blue components. Each datum is an 8-bit unsigned pixel<br />
component value.<br />
Note that <a href="GetVideoLine" class="uri">GetVideoLine</a> is asynchronous w.r.t. internal line buffer writes. If<br />
the top raster line is modified between two video frames, and <a href="GetVideoLine" class="uri">GetVideoLine</a><br />
executes while the new top raster line is being received, then the returned data<br />
could be a combination of the old and new data.</p>
