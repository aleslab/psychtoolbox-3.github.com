<p>This program allows exploration of how well we can fit<br />
CIE cone fundamentals with various photopigment nomograms,<br />
by allowing the lambdaMax to vary.</p>
<p>Note from DHB. My conclusion after spending some time with<br />
this is that the best current approach, in the context of the<br />
CIE fundamentals, is to use the <a href="StockmanSharpe" class="uri">StockmanSharpe</a> nomogram and<br />
its nominal lambdaMax values. The fit to the 2-degree CIE<br />
fundamentals is not perfect, but it is pretty good. I think<br />
the deviations between what is produced by the nominal<br />
nomogram fit are probaby small compared with our certainty<br />
about the fundamentals (this is just intuition, but for example<br />
the deviations are small compared to those between the Stockman-Sharpe<br />
and Smith-Pokorny fundamentals). One could try to develope a better<br />
nomogram, for example by taking the ser/ala polymorphism explicitly<br />
into account when fitting it, but I’m not sure that would win if one<br />
wants to keep the convenient assumption of constant photopigment<br />
absorbance shape along a log wavelength axis.</p>
<p>If one really wanted to go after fitting the fundamentals from parts,<br />
searching on various densities as well as the lambda max values<br />
would probably be the way to go.</p>
