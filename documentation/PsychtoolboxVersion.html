<p>[versionString, versionStructure]=<a href="PsychtoolboxVersion" class="uri">PsychtoolboxVersion</a></p>
<p>Return a string identifying this release of the Psychtoolbox.<br />
The first three numbers identify the base version of Psychtoolbox:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Leftmost: Increments indicate a disruptive change in the feature<br />
set and design of the software, by abrupt introduction of design changes.<br />
This should never happen, as this would mean a completely new product,<br />
entirely incompatible with the old software.</p></li>
<li><p>Middle: Increments indicate significant enhancements or changes in<br />
functionality. This will usually only happen every couple of years at<br />
most.</p></li>
<li><p>Rightmost: A counter to distinguish multiple releases having the same<br />
leftmost and middle version numbers. This happens if there are backwards<br />
incompatible changes to the programming interface or functionality which<br />
may require code adjustments in user code. It also happens if we cancel<br />
support for platforms (Matlab/Octave versions, operating system versions,<br />
processor architectures etc.). This happens occassionally.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Numeric values of the three integer fields contained in versionString are<br />
available in fields of the second return argument, “versionStructure”.</p>
<h3 id="the-field-flavor-defines-the-subtype-of-psychtoolbox-being-used">The field ‘Flavor’ defines the subtype of Psychtoolbox being used:</h3>
<p>* beta: An experimental release that is already tested by the developers,<br />
but not yet sufficiently tested or proven in the field. Beta releases<br />
contain lots of new and experimental features that may be useful to you<br />
but that may change slightly in behaviour or syntax in the final release,<br />
making it necessary for you to adapt your code after a software update.<br />
Beta releases are known to be imperfect and fixing bugs in them is not a<br />
high priority. The term ‘current’ is a synonym for ‘beta’. Beta releases<br />
are the only releases we provide at this point.</p>
<p>* trunk: Development prototypes, for testing and debugging by developers<br />
and really adventuruous users, not for production use!</p>
<p>* Psychtoolbox-x.y.z: Old, no longer supported Psychtoolbox versions.</p>
<p>* Debian package: A Psychtoolbox provided by GNU/Debian or <a href="NeuroDebian" class="uri">NeuroDebian</a>.</p>
<p>The revision number and the provided URL allows you to visit the developer<br />
website in the Internet and get direct access to all development logs<br />
regarding your working copy of Psychtoolbox.</p>
<p>Be aware that execution of the <a href="PsychtoolboxVersion" class="uri">PsychtoolboxVersion</a> command can take a<br />
lot of time (in the order of multiple seconds to 1 minute).</p>
<p>Most Psychtoolbox mex files now provide a built-in ‘Version’ command<br />
which returns version for themselves. The version string for the<br />
built-in version numbers contains a fourth numeric field named “build”.<br />
The build number is a unique serial number. Mex files distinquished only<br />
by build numbers were compiled from identical C source files.</p>
