Look at how the quantities in the CIE standard that depend on field size vary with   
field size, particularly for field sizes greater than 10-degrees, which  
is the outer limit of what the standard sanctions.  
  
My conclusions are  
  1. that since we know macular pigment is declining towards zero with  
  field size (see refs below) and the CIE expoential formula has this  
  property, it is resonable to use the CIE formula for macular pigment  
  density for field sizes greater than 10-degrees.  
  2. the CIE formula for pigment optical density asymptotes to a constant  
  as one extends past 10-degrees.  Whether this is true in the retina or  
  not, I am not sure.  But as field size gets larger, using this formula  
  is going to be no worse than simply using the 10-degree values, since  
  they are the same.    
  3. one needs to take any estimate of the [CMFs](CMFs) for large field sizes  
  with a grain of salt.  There is going to be variation across the field,  
  so any point estimate is likely to be wrong somewhere.  The CIE  
  formulae, extended using the formulae past their bounds, are a good  
  first guess for the mean field properties, but being aware that there  
  is variation within the field, as well as individual variation around  
  the CIE estimates, is important when considering things like the effect  
  of inadvertant stimulation of cones when one tries to isolate  
  melanopsin using silent substitution.  Note in particular that the CIE  
  formula is trying to capture large field color matches where subjects  
  are instructed to ignore the center of the field as best they can.  In  
  a threshold experiment, this might not be how subjects were instructed  
  and would in any case be rather hard to do.  And if you used annular  
  stimuli, you'd be a bit off and might want to think about how to  
  estimate the fundamentals from the annulus.  Studying the Moreland and  
  Alexander paper below in detail might help with thinking on that.

  matching with field sizes in the 1 deg to 10 deg range.  Doc. Opth.  
  Proc. Ser., 59, 363-368.  
        Moreland and Alexander make color matches for annuli and for  
        circular fields, and develop a formula for the equivalent macular  
        pigment density for color matches of various field sizes.  In  
        these matches, observers are instructed to to ignore the central  
        Maxwell?s spot, I am pretty sure. M&A say the data are consistent  
        with the idea that obsevers look near the edge of the field but  
        not quite at it.  Their data are for field sizes of 10 degrees,  
        and the estimates are fit with exponentials.  M&A used these data  
        together with measurements of macular pigment density by Moreland  
        & Bhatt (1884) to develop an equivalent (for uniform fields)  
        macular pigment density to be used in predicting color matches  
        out to 10 degrees.  The formula is an exponential decay.  
        Something like this made it into the CIE standard, although it  
        may have been tweaked to make sure the color matching data are  
        consistent with the 10-deg and 2-deg [CMFs](CMFs).  I have not thought  
        hard about the underlying calculations.

        Uses color-matching data for field sizes out to 18 deg (I think)  
        to develop estimates of macular pigment density as a function of  
        eccentricity.  Key feature of the data is that density estimates  
        decline according to an exponential and reach zero at  
        eccentricity (radius) of about 7 degrees.  This paper also  
        reviews earlier estimates and they all look like decaying  
        exponentials.
