<p>Get information about the computer. The result is a struct holding information<br />
about your computer. Top-level flags in the returned struct are available on all<br />
operating systems and identify the operating system: ‘macintosh’, ‘windows’,<br />
‘osx’, ‘linux’. ‘system’ contains info about the operating system version.<br />
‘gstreamer’ tells if [<a href="GStreamer" class="uri">GStreamer</a>][(GStreamer)]((GStreamer)) support is compiled into <a href="Screen" class="uri">Screen</a>(). ‘supported’<br />
tells if the given operating system was supported by the given Psychtoolbox at<br />
the time of the Psychtoolbox release, ie., if the given system was tested and<br />
shown to work with the given Psychtoolbox, so there can be some expectation of<br />
Psychtoolbox working with this system. This doesn’t mean that you will get<br />
support in case of problems though, as support for your system may have ended if<br />
it isn’t a recent enough system. ‘MACAddress’ may contain the MAC address of<br />
your ethernet adapter.<br />
All other fields or additional sub-structures are platform-dependent, so their<br />
presence can not be relied on.<br />
SCREEN ‘Computer’ not longer supports the obsolete usage:<br />
[model,owner,system,processor,cache,fpu,hz,busHz,vm,pci,emulating]=SCREEN(‘Computer’)</p>
