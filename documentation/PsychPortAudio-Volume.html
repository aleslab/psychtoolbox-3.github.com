<p>Set audio output volume(s) and/or return old volumes for a device ‘pahandle’.<br />
The device must be open for this setting to take effect. It is initially set to<br />
1.0. On a regular audio device or master device, you can only set the global<br />
‘masterVolume’ for the whole device. On a slave device, you can optionally<br />
define a per-channel volume vector ‘channelVolumes’. E.g., if your slave device<br />
has two output channels, a ‘channelVolumes’ vector of [0.9 ; 0.25] would set the<br />
first channel to 90% intensity, the 2nd channel to 25% intensity. The elements<br />
of ‘channelVolumes’ and the ‘masterVolume’ can be any value. The value for a<br />
device or a channel is simply multiplied with each output sample before output<br />
to the hardware, so that a value of 1.0 (the default setting for each device and<br />
channel) will pass samples unmodified, a value of 0.5 would reduce intensity to<br />
50%, a value of 1.25 would amplify to 125% of the original value, or a value of<br />
-1 would invert the signal.<br />
Be careful with amplification (values &gt; 1). If the final sample leaves the valid<br />
output range of -1.0 to 1.0, you may hear ugly auditory clipping artifacts and<br />
possibly damage your ears or speakers! In ‘normal’ mode, <a href="PsychPortAudio" class="uri">PsychPortAudio</a> clamps<br />
output samples to the valid range of -1 to 1, but in high timing precision/low<br />
latency mode, clamping is not performed in order to save computation time.</p>
<p>Caution: All volume settings are silently ignored on regular audio devices or<br />
master devices if audio monitoring mode is active. On a slave device,<br />
per-channel volumes would be still applied in monitoring mode, but not the<br />
masterVolume. This is for efficiency reasons. If you need volume settings in<br />
monitoring mode, then open a master device, attach a slave device to it in<br />
monitoring mode, then set the ‘channelVolumes’ of that slave device to control<br />
volume of monitoring.</p>
<p>Caution: The volume settings only affect what is sent to your computers sound<br />
system. The operating system or audio hardware itself may apply additional<br />
volume settings, gains, filters etc., depending on your specific setup. These<br />
are only controllable via external system specific tools, <a href="PsychPortAudio" class="uri">PsychPortAudio</a> doesn’t<br />
know about such additional settings and can’t control them in any way!</p>
<p>If you need to modulate output volume over time, you can also attach an<br />
additional slave device whose opMode is set to act as an <a href="AMmodulator" class="uri">AMmodulator</a> to a master<br />
or slave device, see help for ‘OpenSlave’. Such a slave device will not output<br />
sound itself, but use the data stored in its playback buffers to modulate the<br />
amplitude of its parent slave, or of the summed signal of all previously<br />
attached slaves for a master over time. Example: You create a master device,<br />
then ‘OpenSlave’ three regular slave devices, then ‘OpenSlave’ a <a href="AMmodulator" class="uri">AMmodulator</a><br />
slave device. During playback, the sound signals of the three regular slaves<br />
will be mixed together. The combined signal will be multiplied by the per-sample<br />
volume values provided by the <a href="AMmodulator" class="uri">AMmodulator</a> slave device, thereby modulating the<br />
amplitude or ‘’acoustic envelope’’ of the mixed signals. The resulting signal<br />
will be played by the master device. If you’d attach more regular slave devices<br />
after the <a href="AMmodulator" class="uri">AMmodulator</a>, their signal would not get modulated, but simply added to<br />
the modulated signal of the first three devices.</p>
<p>You can also modulate only the signals of a specific slave device, by attaching<br />
the modulator to that slave device in the ‘OpenSlave’ call. You’d simply pass<br />
the handle of the slave that should be modulated to ‘OpenSlave’, instead of the<br />
handle of a master device.</p>
