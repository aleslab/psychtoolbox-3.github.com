<p>This script compares values calculated by PTB and routines in isetbio (developed by<br />
Wandell and colleague) for various colorimetric functions.</p>
<p>For information on isetbio, see https://github.com/wandell/vset/blob/master/README.txt.<br />
It contains its own implementation of many of the colorimetric computations<br />
implemented in PTB. Note that Brainard and Wandell are not completely<br />
independent sources.</p>
<p>Make sure isetbio is on your path to run these comparisons. The tests should<br />
also work if you have the proprietary iset on your path instead.<br />
isetbio is available on gitHub as https://github.com/wandell/isetbio.git.</p>
<p>The checks are grouped into cells that check one thing at a time.</p>
<p>Because DHB and BAW have too much time on their hands -<br />
“A man with one watch always knows what time it is, a man with two is never sure.”<br />
“A man with SPM knows how to blur and average his watches so that he can’t tell the time”</p>
<p>7/7/10 dhb Wrote it.<br />
x/xx/10 baw Checked with ISET-4.0 revision 351 (BW)<br />
2/28/13 dhb Updated to work with vset rather than proprietary iset.<br />
8/5/13 dhb Updated to work with isetbio, vset’s successor.<br />
7/31/14 dhb, ncp Put a cd around call to isetbio xyz2lab to deal with<br />
fact that 2014b has added a routine with this name that<br />
doesn’t work quite the same.</p>
