[ClutAnimDemo](ClutAnimDemo)([method=2])  
  
Display an animated grating using CLUT animation via the  
[Screen](Screen)('LoadNormalizedGammaTable') command, or via the [PsychImaging](PsychImaging)()  
based clut animation support.  
  
Clut animation is an ancient technique of achieving animation, only  
needed or the best choice for very few use cases nowadays. Think twice  
before using this as your method of choice. It may work, but is inefficient,  
potentially unreliable in the timing domain (except for method 2) and most  
often more painful and inflexible to use than a proper modern approach.  
  
If 'method' is set to 0, hardware gamma tables are immediately updated.  
A setting of 1 will update hardware gamma tables in sync with [Screen](Screen)('[Flip](Flip)'),  
or more accurately, it will try to. Synchronization can't be guaranteed,  
only that a good effort is made to achieve sync.  
A 'method' setting of 2, which is the default, will use the Psychtoolbox image  
processing pipeline to implement clut animation, instead of updating the  
hardware gamma tables. This is the only reliable method with respect to  
timing precision. It is also the only method that works on MS-Windows.  
However, it requires recent graphics hardware and a bit more computation  
time.  
  
Method 2 is recommended for most use cases, method 0 is the least  
reliable one.
