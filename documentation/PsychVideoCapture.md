[PsychVideoCapture](PsychVideoCapture) -- Video capture support  
  
Psychtoolbox has built-in [Screen](Screen) subfunctions that allow you to control  
and use standard and professional video capture equipment to capture live  
video from a camera or other supported video source in real-time with low  
latency.  
  
This is useful for studies on (manipulated) visual feedback, e.g.,  
action-perception studies, as well as for future applications like vision  
based eye-trackers.  
  
The M-Files in this folder use the [Screen](Screen) - Low-level functions to  
provide more convenient high-level access to standard video capture  
tasks, e.g., setup of the camera or a video feedback loop with low and  
controlled latency.  
  
The functions are well tested and known to work perfectly on Linux.  
Support on [MacOS](MacOS)-X and Windows is not always as feature rich, flexible  
and mature as on Linux. Especially, the OS-X and Windows versions are not  
as extensively tested. Some of the functions here are work in progress,  
useful, but not finished.  
  
[Screen](Screen)() supports two separate built-in videocapture engines for  
different purposes:  
  
### PROFESSIONAL CLASS ENGINE FOR DEMANDING APPLICATIONS:  
  
For demanding pro-applications that require precise low-level control  
over your camera's features and capture parameters, high capture  
framerates, image resolutions, color depths and processing efficiency,  
low-latency, high timing precision and high capture timestamp precision,  
[Screen](Screen) implements a firewire videocapture engine which is based on the  
free-software and open-source cross-platform library "libdc1394". This  
engine supports professional IEEE-1394 machine vision cameras conforming  
to the IIDC 1.0 machine vision camera specification. These can be  
connected via IEEE-1394 firewire bus, or for some special examplars also  
via high-performance USB bus via "Firewire-over-USB" protocol. This  
high-perf capture engine is selected as default via the following [Screen](Screen)  
preference setting:  
  
[Screen](Screen)('[Preference](Preference)', 'DefaultVideocaptureEngine', 1);  
  
Alternatively you can select it on a case-by-case basis by passing the  
value 1 as optional 'engineID' parameter for the  
[Screen](Screen)('OpenVideocapture', ...); command.  
  
See <http://damien.douxchamps.net/ieee1394/libdc1394/\> for information  
about the libdc1394 library, forums and links to the IIDC-Spec.  
  
A list of supported firewire pro-cameras can be found here:  
<http://damien.douxchamps.net/ieee1394/cameras/\>  
  
The firewire engine is currently supported on Linux, where it was  
originally developed, extensively tested and used, and on [MacOSX](MacOSX), where  
it received some light testing and use. Therefore, the Linux version is  
the most mature and well-tested one. It allows very convenient and  
fine-grained control over many aspects and settings of the cameras, it  
reliably can drive multiple cameras in parallel (tested with two cameras)  
and it has excellent timing, very low capture latency and highly accurate  
built-in timestamping code. The reported timestamps are accurate to a few  
dozen microseconds.  
  
You will need Linux kernel 2.4.21 or later or Linux 2.6.16 or later for  
best performance, but these are part of any recent distribution.  
  
### Supported Cameras:  
  
All IIDC compliant cameras should work. For the Basler A602f greyscale  
high performance camera, the Basler A312fc, and the cheap and good  
Unibrain Fire-i camera, the [PsychCamSettings](PsychCamSettings) - Tool provides especially  
convenient access to the camera settings.  
  
You can find additional setup instructions for the libdc1394 engine in  
'help VideoCaptureDC1394'. Executing [VideoCaptureDC1394](VideoCaptureDC1394) on OSX will  
install the runtime library for you.  
  
  
### CONSUMER LEVEL ENGINE FOR LESS STRINGENT REQUIREMENTS:  
  
This engine is targeted at standard consumer class video capture and  
video digitizer equipment, e.g., built-in cameras of Laptop computers,  
USB or Firewire connected "webcams", DV camcorders, standard video  
converters and receivers etc. Quality of feature control, efficiency,  
attainable framerates and resolutions, precision of timing or capture  
timestamps and other properties vary on a model-by-model,  
vendor-by-vendor, operating-system-by-operating-system basis. While some  
relatively cheap cameras work very well on some operating systems, e.g.,  
the "Sony [PlayStation](PlayStation) Eye" USB web-camera, no guarantess can be made  
about the performance or quality of any specific camera.  
  
[Screen](Screen) supports a [[GStreamer](GStreamer)][(GStreamer)]((GStreamer)) based engine on all operating systems.  
  
We use [[GStreamer](GStreamer)][(GStreamer]((GStreamer))'s built-in videocapture functionality by default (see  
"help [[GStreamer](GStreamer)][(GStreamer)]((GStreamer))"). This is highly reliable and feature rich on Linux,  
somewhat less feature rich and reliable but still decent on Windows and  
OSX -- highly dependent on the version of Windows you are using. The  
engine should support most commercially available consumer level cameras  
for firewire, USB, PCI and other busses, basically any camera for which  
the operating system and [[GStreamer](GStreamer)][(GStreamer)]((GStreamer)) provide a device driver.  
  
This engine has id 3 and is selected by default on all operating systems.  
You can find additional setup instructions for [[GStreamer](GStreamer)][(GStreamer)]((GStreamer)) in 'help  
[[GStreamer](GStreamer)][(GStreamer]((GStreamer))'.
