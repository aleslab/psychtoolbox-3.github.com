<p>This demo shows how to draw high-quality, anti-aliased text, and some<br />
japanese text encoded in Unicode.</p>
<p><a href="MacOS" class="uri">MacOS</a>/X has text fonts with support for japanese characters preinstalled,<br />
so this should just work out of the box. Have a look at the code of the<br />
demo on how to select a suitable font, and how to read unicode text from<br />
the filesystem. The (commented out) reading code for SHIFT_JIS -&gt; Unicode<br />
conversion would only work on recent Matlab releases. Older releases need<br />
different approaches - also different wrt. <a href="PowerPC" class="uri">PowerPC</a> vs. <a href="IntelMac" class="uri">IntelMac</a>. That’s<br />
why we hard-coded the text in this demo – Want to have it working even<br />
on old Matlab 6…</p>
<p>On MS-Windows you will need to install the special east-asian font<br />
support kit in order to be able to draw japanese text.<br />
How to do this? See…</p>

<p>with some more info here:<br />

<p>After that, text drawing seems to “just work” with our “Courier New”<br />
font. If you don’t install the font pack, you’ll just see funny little<br />
squares instead of nice japanese characters…</p>
<p>On <a href="MacOS" class="uri">MacOS</a>/X you have the choice between three different text<br />
rendering/layouting methods, as selectable by the <a href="Screen" class="uri">Screen</a> preference<br />
setting ‘TextRenderer’: The default is 1, which selects Apple’s ATSU text<br />
renderer. A setting of 0 would also select ATSU but would use a different<br />
method for layout of text. Each method has its own weaknesses in that it<br />
will have trouble drawing text in some special fonts correctly, so you<br />
may have to choose the method based on the font to get best results.<br />
Typical standard fonts are handled correctly by both methods. A setting<br />
of 2 will use the Linux text rendering plugin (see “help <a href="DrawTextPlugin" class="uri">DrawTextPlugin</a>”)<br />
which in our experience handles all fonts well and is of superior<br />
performance to the OSX ATSU renderer. However, given that historically<br />
ATSU was used on OSX for many years and each layout and rendering method<br />
will give slightly different text appearance, for reason of consistency<br />
we leave the default setting for OSX on 1, instead of using the superior<br />
setting 2.</p>
