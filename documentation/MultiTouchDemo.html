<p><a href="MultiTouchDemo" class="uri">MultiTouchDemo</a>([dev]) - A advanced demo for multi-touch touchscreens.</p>
<p>Run it. Pressing any key will stop it.</p>
<p>Touch the screen and watch the nice colorful happy blobs<br />
sprinkle to life :)</p>
<p>The demo will try to use the first available touchscreen, or if<br />
there isn’t any touchscreen, the first available touchpad. You<br />
can also select a specific touch device by passing in its ‘dev’<br />
device handle. Use of touchpads usually needs special configuration.<br />
See “help <a href="TouchInput" class="uri">TouchInput</a>” for more info.</p>
<p>If you set ‘verbose’ to 1, then all the available info about each<br />
touch point will be displayed close to the touch point. As drawing<br />
so much text is very slow, the demo will only update touchpoints<br />
very slowly!</p>
<p>The demo not only tracks and display touches and their location, as<br />
well as their timing. It also uses info about the shape of the contact,<br />
visualizing this as aspect ratio of the drawn rectangle. It tries to<br />
get info about the contacts orientation and draws accordingly. It tries<br />
to get (or derive) info about touch pressure and modulates the brightness<br />
of the rectangle accordingly. One property not used, but available would<br />
be distance for fingers or tools hovering over a touch surface, if that<br />
surface provides that info.</p>
<p>This demo currently only works on Linux + X11 display system,<br />
not on Linux + Wayland, not on other operating systems.</p>
