<p>Return an array of screenNumbers. If this command is executed on Microsoft<br />
Windows in a multi-display configuration, then the following rule applies:<br />
<a href="Screen" class="uri">Screen</a> 0 is always the full Windows desktop. Screens 1 to n are corresponding to<br />
windows display monitors 1 to n. If you want to open an onscreen window only on<br />
one specific display, or you want to query or set the properties of a display<br />
(e.g., framerate, size, color depth or gamma tables), use the screen numbers 1<br />
to n. If you want to open a window suitable for stereo display on a dual display<br />
setup, use screen zero.<br />
When executed on OS/X with the optional ‘physicalDisplays’ flag set to 1, will<br />
enumerate the set of physical displays, which can be different from the set of<br />
logical displays that is returned by default. E.g., in mirror mode or clone<br />
mode, there is only one logical display, representing the mirror set of all<br />
physical displays. This is mostly useful to set, e.g., gamma tables on a per<br />
display basis, even if in mirror mode.</p>
