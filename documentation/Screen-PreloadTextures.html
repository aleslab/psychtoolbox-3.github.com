<p>Try to preload textures into VRAM to facilitate fast drawing. This method tries<br />
to upload textures into the local (and fast) VRAM of your graphics hardware<br />
before start of trial. This can reduce texture drawing time by avoiding the<br />
upload delay. “windowPtr” Handle for onscreen window whose textures should be<br />
preloaded. “texids” is a vector which contains the texture handles of all<br />
textures which should be preloaded into VRAM. If no vector is given, PTB tries<br />
to preload all textures into VRAM. The return value ‘resident’ tells you, if all<br />
requested textures could be preloaded. A value of 1 means full success. The<br />
‘texidresident’ vector tells you for each texture, if that specific texture<br />
could be preloaded. Preloading requested textures can fail if your gfx-hardware<br />
has an insufficient amount of free VRAM memory.</p>
