<p>Modify requested start time ‘when’ of an already started <a href="PortAudio" class="uri">PortAudio</a> audio device.<br />
After you’ve started an audio device via the ‘Start’ subfunction, but *before*<br />
the device has really started playback (because the ‘when’ time provided to the<br />
‘Start’ method is still far in the future), you can use this function to<br />
reschedule the start for a different ‘when’ time - including a value of zero for<br />
immediate start.</p>
<p>The ‘pahandle’ is the handle of the device to start. Starting a device means:<br />
Start playback of output devices, start recording on capture device, do both on<br />
full duplex devices. ‘waitForStart’ if set to 1 will wait until device has<br />
really started, default is to continue immediately, ie. only schedule start of<br />
device. ‘when’ Requested time, when device should start. Defaults to zero,<br />
i.e. start immediately. If set to a non-zero system time, PTB will do its best to<br />
start the device at the requested time, but the accuracy of start depends on the<br />
operating system, audio hardware and system load. If ‘waitForStart’ is set to<br />
non-zero value, ie if PTB should wait for sound onset, then the optional return<br />
argument ‘startTime’ will contain an estimate of when the first audio sample hit<br />
the speakers, i.e., the real start time.<br />
Please note that the ‘when’ value always refers to playback, so it defines the<br />
starttime of playback. The start time of capture is related to the start time of<br />
playback in duplex mode, but it isn’t the same. In pure capture mode (without<br />
playback), ‘when’ will be ignored and capture always starts immediately. See the<br />
help for subfunction ‘GetStatus’ for more info on the meaning of the different<br />
timestamps.<br />
The ‘repetitions’ parameter will change the number of playback repetitions if<br />
provided. The value for ‘repetitions’ from the <a href="PsychPortAudio" class="uri">PsychPortAudio</a>(‘Start’) function<br />
will be used if the parameter is omitted. See explanation in the ‘Start’<br />
function for its meaning.<br />
‘stopTime’ is an optional override for the ‘stopTime’ parameter from the ‘Start’<br />
function, see explanations there.</p>
