<p>A demonstration of basic usage and functionality of the <a href="RTBox" class="uri">RTBox</a> reaction time box.</p>
<p>Usage: <a href="PsychRTBoxDemo" class="uri">PsychRTBoxDemo</a></p>
<p>This demo shows the basics of using the <a href="PsychRTBox" class="uri">PsychRTBox</a> function to control<br />
and use the “USTC - <a href="RTBox" class="uri">RTBox</a>” reaction time box, a response button box for<br />
response collection from subjects with high timing accuracy.</p>
<p>You must have a compatible box attached to one of the USB ports of your<br />
computer and the FTDI Serial-Over-USB drivers must be properly installed<br />
and configured on your machine. Otherwise the demo will fail to start.</p>
<p>Only the most basic operations of the box are demonstrated with the most<br />
basic parameter settings to get you started. Other demos will provide<br />
more detailed introduction into more advanced features.</p>
<p>First the demo tests &amp; shows basic live button queries.<br />
Then a fake reaction time experiment is run for four trials. You have to<br />
press a button on the box in response to a beep sound as fast as possible<br />
and your reaction time is measured. A post-hoc method for retrieving the<br />
timestamps of the button events is shown. This method is fast and<br />
accurate, but only provides results after a session is finished, so<br />
programming may appear a bit awkward to some users.</p>
<p>Then the same reaction time experiment is run again, this time<br />
implementing a different method to retrieve button timestamps “live”<br />
during the experiment session within each trial. This method is also<br />
accurate, but involves a calibration procedure which takes about 0.5<br />
seconds in each trial and therefore slows down the progress of each trial<br />
a bit.</p>

detailed explanation of all commands and more commands.</p>
