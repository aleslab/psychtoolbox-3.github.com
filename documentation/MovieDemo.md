The comments below review the difference between the OS 9 version of  
the toolbox and PTB-3.  
  
### New and different on OS Psychtoolbox:   
  
 The OS 9 Psychtoolbox is based on [QuickTime](QuickTime) and PTB-3 is  
 based on [OpenGL](OpenGL).  Differences between these underlying graphics libraries  
 have unavoidably resulted in differences between the OS 9 and PTB-3  
 versions of [Screen](Screen); Some subfunctions of OS 9 [Screen](Screen) are replaced by  
 similar, but not identical functions in PTB-3.  
  
 In OS 9:                   In PTB-3  
  
  [WaitBlanking](WaitBlanking)              [Flip](Flip)          
  [PutImage](PutImage)                  [MakeTexture](MakeTexture)  
  [CopyWindow](CopyWindow)                [DrawTexture](DrawTexture)  
  
 [WaitVBL](WaitVBL) vs. [Flip](Flip)  
  
  In OS 9 an onscreen window consisted of only one buffer: the front  
  buffer.  Any pixel drawn to an onscreen window would automatically  
  appear on the display as soon as the monitor scan passed  that pixel,  
  the maximum delay between drawing a pixel and its appearnce on the  
  monitor being one frame period.  To  prevent vertical shearing of  
  animated displays, Psyhctoolbox scripts called [WaitBlanking](WaitBlanking) before  
  updating the display.  [WaitBlanking](WaitBlanking) synchonrized drawing into vide RAM  
  wih the monitor scan by delaying the onset of drawing until the scan  
  reached the bottom right corener of the display, at which point a  
  vertical blank would occur while the CRT beam retraced to the upper  
  left corner of the display.  
  
  In contrast, PTB-3 onscreen windows by default have not one but two  
  buffers:  the front buffer and the back buffer.  In double-buffered  
  mode, all [Screen](Screen) drawing commands are issued to the back buffer, where  
  what is drawn is hidden from view.  The contents of the back buffer  
  remain hidden from view until The [Screen](Screen)('[Flip](Flip)', ...) command is  
  issued. [Flip](Flip) waits  until the vertical retrace and then interchages the  
  contents of the front and back buffers, bringining into view on the  
  display what had previosly been hidden in the back buffer.   
  
 [OpenOffscrenWindow](OpenOffscrenWindow) + [PutImage](PutImage) + [CopyWindow](CopyWindow) vs. [MakeTexture](MakeTexture) + [DrawTexture](DrawTexture)  
  
  In OS 9, [PutImage](PutImage) copied a MATLAB matrix into an offsceen window.  The  
  offscreen Window could then be quickly copied to the display during an  
  animation.  Thus  [PutImage](PutImage) was one part of three for quickly  
  displaying MATLAB matrices during an animation:  
  
      Steps to quickly display an image matrix in OS 9:  
        1. Create an offscreen window by calling [OpenOffscreenWindow](OpenOffscreenWindow)  
        2. Copy the matrix to an offsceen window using [PutImage](PutImage)  
        3. Copy the offscreen window to an onscreen window using  
        [CopyWindow](CopyWindow)  
  
  Instead of using Offscreen Windows to quickly display MATLAB Matrices   
  the OSX Psychtoolbox uses Textures.  
  
      Steps to quickly display an image matrix in PTB-3:    
        1. Create a texture and copy into it a matrix by using [MakeTexture](MakeTexture)  
        2. Copy the texture quickly to the onscreen window using  
        [DrawTexure](DrawTexure)  
  
  What is the difference betwen offscreen windows and textures? The  
  difference is that Drawing commands such as [FillOval](FillOval) may be  issued to  
  offscreen windows but not to Textures; You may only fill textures by  
  using matrices.   
  
  How do we draw ovals during an animation if we can not store them  
  within offscren or textures? Unlike [QuickDraw](QuickDraw), [OpenGL](OpenGL) is fast enought  
  to render all drawing commands directly to the display during an  
  animation loop. Except for MATLAB matrices stored in textures, there  
  should be no need to prerender and buffer what is displayed during  
  animation.    
  
 Animation loops: OS 9 VS PTB-3  
  
  To understand the differences between OS 9 and PTB-3 [Screen](Screen) its helpful  
  to compare animation loops:  
  
###   OS 9:   
  
      %create and fill offscreen windows here...   
      for i=1:numberOfMovieFrames  
          [Screen](Screen)(window, 'WaitBlanking');  
          [Screen](Screen)('CopyWindow', offscreenWindow(i), window);  
      end  
  
###   PTB-3:   
  
      %generate textures here...  
      for i=1:numberOfMovieFrames  
          [Screen](Screen)('DrawTexture', texture(i), window);  
          [Screen](Screen)(window, '[Flip](Flip)');  
      end
