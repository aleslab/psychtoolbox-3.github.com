<p>One of the great contributions of psychophysics to psychology is the<br />
notion of measuring threshold, i.e. the signal strength required for a<br />
criterion level of response by the observer (Pelli &amp; Farell, 1994;<br />
Farell &amp; Pelli, 1999). Watson and Pelli (1983) described a maximum<br />
likelihood procedure, which they called QUEST, for estimating threshold.<br />
The Quest toolbox in the Psychtoolbox is a set of MATLAB functions<br />
that implement all the original QUEST functions, plus several others.<br />
You can think of it as a Bayesian toolbox for testing observers and<br />
estimating their thresholds. This QUEST toolbox is self-contained,<br />
and runs on any computer with MATLAB 5 or better.<br />

<p>By commenting and uncommenting five lines below, you can use this file<br />
to implement three QUEST-related procedures for measuring threshold.</p>
<p><a href="QuestMode" class="uri">QuestMode</a>: In the original algorithm of Watson &amp; Pelli (1983), each<br />
trial is at the MODE of the posterior pdf. Their final estimate is<br />
maximum likelihood, which is the MODE of the posterior pdf after<br />
dividing out the prior pdf. (Subsequent experience has shown that it’s<br />
better not to divide out the prior, simply using MODE of posterior pdf<br />
throughout.)</p>
<p><a href="QuestMean" class="uri">QuestMean</a>: In the improved algorithm of King-Smith et al. (1994), each<br />
trial and the final estimate are at the MEAN of the posterior pdf.</p>
<p><a href="QuestQuantile" class="uri">QuestQuantile</a> &amp; <a href="QuestMean" class="uri">QuestMean</a>: In the ideal algorithm of Pelli (1987), each<br />
trial is at the best QUANTILE, and the final estimate is at the MEAN of<br />
the posterior pdf.</p>
<p>You begin by calling <a href="QuestCreate" class="uri">QuestCreate</a>, telling Quest what is your prior<br />
knowledge, i.e. a guess and associated sd for threshold. Then you run<br />
some number of trials, typically 40. For each trial you ask Quest to<br />
recommend a test intensity. Then you actually test the observer at some<br />
intensity, not necessarily what Quest recommended, and then you call<br />
<a href="QuestUpdate" class="uri">QuestUpdate</a> to report to Quest the actual intensity used and whether the<br />
observer got it right. Quest saves this information in your Quest struct,<br />
which we usually call “q”. This cycle is repeated for each trial. Finally,<br />
at the end, when you’re done, you ask Quest to provide a final threshold<br />
estimate, usually the mean and sd (of the posterior pdf).</p>
<p>It is important to realize that Quest is merely a friendly adviser,<br />
cataloging your data in your q structure, and making statistical<br />
analyses of it, but never giving you orders. You’re still in charge. On<br />
each trial, you ask Quest (by calling <a href="QuestMode" class="uri">QuestMode</a>, or <a href="QuestMean" class="uri">QuestMean</a>, or<br />
<a href="QuestQuantile">QuestQuantile)</a>) to suggest the best intensity for the next trial. Taking<br />
that as advice, in your experiment you should then select the intensity<br />
yourself for the next trial, taking into account the limitations of your<br />
equipment and experiment. Typically you’ll impose a maximum and a<br />
minimum, but your equipment may also restrict you to particular discrete<br />
values, and you might have some reason for not repeating a value.<br />
Typically you’ll choose the available intensity closest to what Quest<br />
recommended. In some cases the process of producing the stimulus is so<br />
involved that the exact stimulus intensity is known only after it’s been<br />
shown. Having run the trial, you then report the new datum,<br />
the actual intensity tested and the observer’s response, asking Quest to<br />
add it to the database in q.</p>
<p>To use Quest you must provide an estimated value for beta. Beta<br />
controls the steepness of the Weibull function. Many vision studies use<br />
Michelson contrast to control the visibility of the stimulus. It turns<br />
out that psychometric functions for 2afc detection as a function of<br />
contrast have a beta of roughly 3 for a remarkably wide range of targets<br />
and conditions (Nachmias, 1981). However, you may want to estimate beta<br />
for the particular conditions of your experiment. <a href="QuestBetaAnalysis" class="uri">QuestBetaAnalysis</a> is<br />
provided for that purpose, but please think of it as a limited optional<br />
feature. It allows only two free parameters, threshold and beta. You may<br />
prefer to use a general-purpose maximum likelihood fitting program to<br />
allow more degrees of freedom in fitting a Weibull function to your<br />
psychometric data. However, once you’ve done that it’s likely that<br />
you’ll settle on fixed values for all but threshold and use Quest to<br />
estimate that.</p>
<p>Note that data collected to estimate threshold usually are not<br />
good for estimating beta. The psychometric function is sigmoidal, with a<br />
flat floor, a rise, and a flat ceiling. To estimate threshold you want<br />
all your trials near the steepest (roughly speaking) part of the rise.<br />
To estimate beta, the steepness of the rise, you want to have most of<br />
your trials at the corners, where the rise begins and where it ends. The<br />
usual way to achieve this is to first estimate threshold and then to<br />
collect a large number of trials (e.g. 100) at each of several<br />
intensities chosen to span the domain of the rise. These data can<br />
be plotted, making a nice graph of the psychometric function and<br />
they can be fed to <a href="QuestBetaAnalysis" class="uri">QuestBetaAnalysis</a>, to estimate threshold and beta.</p>
