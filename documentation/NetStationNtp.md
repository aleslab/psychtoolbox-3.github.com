 [NetStation](NetStation) - Basic control of the EGI/[NetStation](NetStation) EEG recording system via  
 TCP/IP network connection. (See http://www.egi.com)  
  
 This function was developed and contributed to Psychtoolbox by Gergely Csibra, 2006-2008.  
 Code is based on Rick Gilmore's routines, 2005. Thanks!  
 Code adapted to [PCs](PCs) (and Macs with Intel architecture) by Zhao Fan, 2008.  
  
  
 General syntax  
  
   [status, error] = [NetStation](NetStation)('command', ...)  
  
   if status == 0, the command has been succesfully executed  
   otherwise see string "error" for error message  
  
 Commands  
  
   [NetStation](NetStation)('Connect', host [, port])  
  
           Establishes TCP/IP connection to the [NetStation](NetStation) host computer.  
           "host" is the hostname as a string (e.g., 'anything.com' or '187.14.176.12')  
           "port" is the ethernet port to be used. Default is 55513.  
  
   [NetStation](NetStation)('Disconnect')  
  
           Disconnects from [NetStation](NetStation) host.  
  
   [NetStation](NetStation)('Synchronize' [, [SynchLimit](SynchLimit)])  
  
           Synchronize to the connected host. "[SynchLimit](SynchLimit)" could specify the maximum allowed difference  
           IN MILLISECONDS. Default is 2.5 ms.  
  
   [NetStation](NetStation)('StartRecording')  
  
           Instructs [NetStation](NetStation) to start recording.  
  
   [NetStation](NetStation)('StopRecording')  
  
           Instructs [NetStation](NetStation) to stop recording.  
  
   [NetStation](NetStation)('Event' [,code] [,starttime] [,duration] [,keycode1] [,keyvalue1] [...])  
   [NetStation](NetStation)('EventNoAck' [,code] [,starttime] [,duration] [,keycode1] [,keyvalue1] [...])  
  
           Send an event to the [NetStation](NetStation) host. The 'EventNoAck' variant doesn't  
           wait for acknowledgement of reception of the event, whereas the 'Event'  
           version does. Note that the 'EventNoAck' command is included for  
           completeness. It is not a good practice to skip waiting for  
           acknowledgements. If time is an important factor, Event commands can be sent  
           at a later opportunity within a session (e.g., in blocks at the end  
           of experiments).  
  
           "code"      The 4-char event code (e.g., 'STIM')  
                       Default: 'EVEN'  
           "starttime" The time IN SECONDS when the event started. The VBL time  
                       returned by [Screen](Screen)('[Flip](Flip)') can be passed here as a parameter.  
                       Default: current time.  
           "duration"  The duration of the event IN SECONDS.  
                       Default: 0.001.  
           "keycode"   The 4-char code of a key (e.g., 'tria').  
           "keyvalue"  The value of the key (any number or string)  
                       The keycode-keyvalue pairs can be repeated arbitrary times.  
  
   [NetStation](NetStation)('FlushReadbuffer');  
  
            Flushes the read buffer.  
  
   Uses a modified version of the TCP/UDP/IP Toolbox 2.0.5, a third party GPL'ed  
   open source toolbox, which is included in Psychtoolbox,  
   but also available from the Mathworks website:  
   http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/loadFile.do?objectId=345  
  
   The toolbox has been modified for lower communication latency.
