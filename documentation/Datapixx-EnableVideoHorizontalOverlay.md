# [Datapixx('EnableVideoHorizontalOverlay')](Datapixx-EnableVideoHorizontalOverlay) 
## [[Psychtoolbox]] &#8250; [[Datapixx]].{mex*,dll} subfunction


Horizontal overlay causes the left and right halves of the video frame to be  
treated as two separate images which are composited, or blended. The resulting  
blended image is then stretched to fill the entire display. As an example, if  
the graphics board is generating a 2048x768 image, then the final display would  
consist principally of the left 1024x768 image, with some parts overlayed by the  
right 1024x768 image. The compositing is done within the rectangle defined by  
Datapixx('SetVideoHorizontalOverlayBounds', boundsRect). Within the bounding  
rectangle, the two images are blended according to an alpha function which is  
defined by calling Datapixx('SetVideoHorizontalOverlayAlpha', alphaTable).  
Because [SetVideoHorizontalOverlayBounds](SetVideoHorizontalOverlayBounds) can be called many times per video  
frame, horizontal overlays can be used to generate very low latency  
gaze-contingent displays, without having to wait for [OpenGL](OpenGL) to page flip.  
See [DatapixxGazeContingentDemo](DatapixxGazeContingentDemo).m for an example.
