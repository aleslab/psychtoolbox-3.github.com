<p>Load or query the hardware gamma table of the specified screen. If you pass a<br />
new ‘clut’ hardware gamma table, then ‘clut’ needs to be a matrix with 1 to<br />
(256-startEntry) rows and 3 columns. Each row corresponds to a single color<br />
index value and contains the Red- green- and blue values to use for output of a<br />
pixel of that color. If you provide ‘startEntry’ then the hardware clut is<br />
overwritten by your table starting at color index ‘startEntry’ instead of<br />
starting at index 0. You are free to provide a clut with only a few rows if you<br />
only want to update a subset of the color indices in the hardware clut. Column 1<br />
is the red value, column 2 is the green value and column 3 is the blue value<br />
that you want to load into the hardware clut for a specific index. Values in the<br />
table have to be in range between 0 (for dark pixel) and ‘max’ (for maximum DAC<br />
output intensity), where ‘max’ depends on the number of bits that the RAMDAC of<br />
your graphics hardware supports. Psychtoolbox currently has no way of knowing<br />
the bit-resolution of your RAMDAC, so you have to provide it in the optional<br />
argument ‘bits’. If you don’t provide a ‘bits’ setting, it defaults to a safe<br />
default of 8-Bits. Some examples for ‘bits’ vs. ‘max’: 8 bits (default) –&gt; max<br />
= 255. 9 bits –&gt; max=511. 10 bits –&gt; max=1023. 12 bits –&gt; max = 4095. On<br />
<a href="MacOS" class="uri">MacOS</a>-X and Linux, this function takes arbitrary clut-tables which makes it<br />
suitable for fast CLUT animation. On Microsoft Windows, only tables with<br />
monotonically increasing values are considered valid. Other tables get rejected<br />
by the operating system – there’s nothing we can do about this incredibly wise<br />
decision of the Microsoft system designers :( , so this function is not suitable<br />
for CLUT animation, but only for linearizing or calibrating display devices.<br />
PLEASE NOTE: <a href="LoadCLUT" class="uri">LoadCLUT</a> is only provided to keep old code from OS-9 PTB and old<br />
Windows PTB working. It is just a wrapper around ‘LoadNormalizedGammaTable’. Use<br />
‘LoadNormalizedGammaTable’ for new code. That function is independent of DAC<br />
resolution as it takes values in a normalized range between 0.0 and 1.0 and<br />
always gives you the highest possible resolution for your gamma table, despite<br />
not knowing the real DAC resolution. This function returns the old CLUT as<br />
optional return argument. If you don’t pass a clut, then it only returns the old<br />
CLUT.</p>
