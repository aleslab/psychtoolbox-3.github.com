<p>Draw many textures at once, either one texture to many locations or many<br />
textures.<br />
This function accepts the same parameters as <a href="Screen" class="uri">Screen</a>(‘DrawTexture’), but it is<br />
optimized for drawing many textures. You can leave out each argument, a default<br />
setting will be used in that case, provide it once to apply it to all drawn<br />
items, or provide a vector or matrix with a individual setting for each drawn<br />
item. If you provide multiple settings per argument, then the number must match<br />
between all arguments.</p>
<p>Examples:<br />
a) One texture drawn to different locations at different orientations: Provide<br />
one texture handle for the texturePointer, a 4 row by n columns matrix for<br />
‘destinationRect’ to provide target rectangles for n locations, provide a n<br />
component vector of ‘rotationAngles’ for the n different orientations of the n<br />
drawn texture patches.<br />
b) n textures drawn to n different locations: Same as a) but provide a n<br />
component vector of ‘texturePointers’ one for each texture to be drawn to one of<br />
n locations at n angles.</p>
