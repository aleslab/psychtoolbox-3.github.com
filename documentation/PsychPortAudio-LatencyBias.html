<p>Set audio output latency bias in seconds to ‘biasSecs’ and/or return old bias<br />
for a device ‘pahandle’. The device must be open for this setting to take<br />
effect. It is reset to zero at each reopening of the device. <a href="PsychPortAudio" class="uri">PsychPortAudio</a><br />
computes a latency value for the expected latency of an audio output device to<br />
get its timing right. If this latency value is slightly off for some reason, you<br />
can provide a bias value with this function to correct the computed value.</p>
<p>Please note that this ‘biasSecs’ setting is applied to either audio playback or<br />
audio capture if your device is configured in simplex mode, either for playback<br />
*or* capture. If your device is opened in full-duplex mode for simultaneous<br />
capture and playback, then the bias value is only applied to the playback timing<br />
and timestamps, but not to the capture timing and timestamps!</p>
<p>See the online help for <a href="PsychPortAudio" class="uri">PsychPortAudio</a> for more in depth explanation of<br />
latencies.</p>
