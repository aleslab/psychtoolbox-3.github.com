<p>Wait until it is certain that a previously initiated<br />
<a href="Screen" class="uri">Screen</a>(‘AsyncFlipBegin’,…); operation for onscreen window ‘windowPtr’ will<br />
happen at next vertical retrace or has happened already, then return timestamps<br />
of when flip operation has happened or when the flip operation will happen.<br />
This function only works on Linux and <a href="MacOS" class="uri">MacOS</a>/X and only with recent AMD/ATI<br />
hardware of the Radeon X1000/HD2000/… series or later (or the equivalent<br />
<a href="FireGL" class="uri">FireGL</a> cards). On <a href="MacOS" class="uri">MacOS</a>/X, the <a href="PsychtoolboxKernelDriver" class="uri">PsychtoolboxKernelDriver</a> needs to be loaded for<br />
this to work (see help <a href="PsychtoolboxKernelDriver">PsychtoolboxKernelDriver)</a>).<br />
The method tries to “read the mind” of your graphics card to find out if the<br />
card will swap the display buffers at the next vertical retrace to interrogate<br />
if the swap is certain, ie., not possibly delayed by graphics card overload,<br />
other overload conditions or system timing jitter/delays.<br />
Ideally it will allow your script to know when stimulus onset will happen a few<br />
milliseconds before stimulus onset. This allows, e.g., to initiate some other<br />
operations that need to be tightly and reliably synchronized to stimulus onset<br />
and that have some small startup latency, so they need some headstart. Examples<br />
would be sound output or output of some slow trigger signal which takes multiple<br />
milliseconds to take action.<br />
This feature only works in fullscreen mode and is considered experimental - It<br />
may or may not work reliably on your setup. Good luck!<br />
Returns a high-precision estimate of the system time (in seconds) when the<br />
actual flip will- or has happened in the return argument ‘VBLTimestamp’. An<br />
estimate of Stimulus-onset time is returned in ‘StimulusOnsetTime’.<br />
‘swapCertainTime’ is the system time when certainty of bufferswap was detected.</p>
