<p>Copy the matrix “imageArray” to a window, very slowly.<br />
This function is not (and will not ever get) supported on <a href="OpenGL" class="uri">OpenGL</a>-ES embedded<br />
graphics hardware.<br />
“rect” is in window coordinates. The whole image is copied to “rect”, scaling if<br />
necessary. The rect default is the imageArray’s rect, centered in the window.<br />
The orientation of the array in the window is identical to that of Matlab’s<br />
numerical array displays in the Command Window. The first pixel is in the upper<br />
left, and the rows are horizontal. imageArray can be a pure luminance matrix, a<br />
RGB color matrix, or a RGBA color matrix with alpha channel. Its data type can<br />
be uint8 (faster) or double. Please note that this function is relatively slow<br />
and inflexible. Have a look at the ‘MakeTexture’ and ‘DrawTexture’ functions for<br />
a faster and more flexible way of drawing image matrices.</p>
