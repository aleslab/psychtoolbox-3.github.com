<p>Returns an estimate of the monitor flip interval for the specified onscreen<br />
window.“windowPtr” is the handle of the onscreen window for which info should be<br />
returned. “nrSamples” If left out, the estimated interval from previous calls to<br />
<a href="GetFlipInterval" class="uri">GetFlipInterval</a> or from the initial calibration done during<br />
<a href="Screen" class="uri">Screen</a>(‘OpenWindow’…) is reported. If set to a value greater zero, PTB will<br />
perform a measurement loop to compute a good estimate. The loop will run until<br />
at least nrSamples valid samples have been taken and standard deviation of the<br />
measurement is below “stddev” seconds. A timeout value “timeout” can be set to<br />
abort the measurement after timeout seconds if the measurement doesn’t converge<br />
for some reason. Timeout is 10 seconds and stddev is 50 microseconds by default.<br />
PTB automatically takes at least 50 valid samples when opening an<br />
onscreen-window, trying to achieve a standard deviation below 100 microseconds,<br />
but timing out after a maximum of 15 seconds. If you require very high<br />
precision, call this routine with values that suit your demands. The returned<br />
monitorRefreshInterval is in seconds, but has sub-millisecond accuracy. The real<br />
number of valid samples taken and the final standard deviation is returned as<br />
well. CAUTION: When using <a href="OpenGL" class="uri">OpenGL</a> flip-frame stereo (stereomode=1 in <a href="OpenWindow">OpenWindow)</a>)<br />
on ATI graphics hardware, the flip interval (as reported here) may be twice as<br />
long as the monitor refresh interval! Using Anti-Aliasing with a high<br />
multiSample level at a high display resolution may also cause the graphics<br />
hardware to switch to a flip-interval twice as long as the monitor refresh<br />
interval, because it is not capable of performing all anti-aliasing computations<br />
in one single refresh interval.</p>
