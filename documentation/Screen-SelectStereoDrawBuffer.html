<p>Select the target buffer for drawing commands in stereo display mode and or<br />
return the current/old buffer selection in ‘currentbuffer’.<br />
This function only applies to stereo mode, it does nothing in mono mode.<br />
“windowPtr” is the pointer to the onscreen stereo window. “bufferid” (optional)<br />
is either == 0 for selecting the left-eye buffer or == 1 for selecting the<br />
right-eye buffer. You need to call this command after each <a href="Screen" class="uri">Screen</a>(‘<a href="Flip" class="uri">Flip</a>’)<br />
command or after drawing to an offscreen window again in order to reestablish<br />
your selection of draw buffer, otherwise the results of drawing operations will<br />
be undefined and most probably not what you want.<br />
“param1” (optional) a parameter whose meaning depends on the active stereo mode:<br />
In stereoModes 1 and 11 (frame sequential stereo) it allows to select if<br />
stimulus onset should happen in an even video refresh interval (value 0) or in<br />
an odd interval (value 1). Even and odd intervals correspond to either left- or<br />
right-eye view, so this allows to choose if you want to have stimulus onset on<br />
left eye or right eye.<br />
If you want to use a stereo display mode, we recommend enabling the imaging<br />
pipeline as well. The imaging pipeline will only work with recent hardware, but<br />
it allows for more reliable stereo operation especially when using low-level<br />
<a href="OpenGL" class="uri">OpenGL</a> for real 3D drawing. It also allows to parameterize aspects of stereo<br />
presentation, e.g., gains and other settings of anaglyph stereo.</p>
