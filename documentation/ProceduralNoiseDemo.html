<p>This demo demonstrates fast drawing of noise patches via use of<br />
procedural texture mapping. It only works on hardware with support for<br />
the GLSL shading language, vertex- and fragment-shaders.</p>
<p>Patches are not encoded into a texture, but instead a little algorithm -<br />
a procedural texture shader - is executed on the graphics processor<br />
(GPU). This is very fast and efficient! All parameters of the patch can<br />
be set individually.</p>
<p>This demo is both, a speed benchmark, and a correctness test. If executed<br />
with the optional benchmark flag set to 2, it will execute a loop where<br />
it repeatedly draws a patch on the GPU and then reads back the noise<br />
patch and computes a histogram over all pixels, so you can verify if the<br />
noise distribution is what you expect.</p>
<p>In benchmark mode (flag set to 1), the patch is drawn as fast as<br />
possible, testing the maximum rate at which your system can draw patchs.</p>
<p>At a default setting of benchmark==0, it just shows nicely drawn patch.</p>
<p>Please note that results in performance and accuracy *will* vary,<br />
depending on the model of your graphics card, gfx-driver version and<br />
possibly operating system. For consistent results, always check before<br />
you measure on different setups! However, the more recent the graphics<br />
card, the faster and more accurate – the latest generation of cards is<br />
supposed to be “just perfect” for vision research…</p>
<p>If you want to draw many patches per frame, you wouldn’t do it like in<br />
this script, but use the batch-drawing version of <a href="Screen" class="uri">Screen</a>(‘DrawTextures’,<br />
…) instead, as demonstrated, e.g., in <a href="DrawingSpeedTest" class="uri">DrawingSpeedTest</a>.m. That way you<br />
could submit the specs (parameters) of all patches in one single matrix<br />
via one single <a href="Screen" class="uri">Screen</a>(‘DrawTextures’); call - this is more efficient and<br />
therefore extra fast!</p>
