<p><a href="DetectionRTInVideoDemo" class="uri">DetectionRTInVideoDemo</a>(moviename, timeOfEvent, trials)</p>
<p>A demo implementation of how to collect reaction time for detection of a<br />
specific time-locked event in a movie file.</p>
<p>Parameters:<br />
moviename - Filename of moviefile to use. If none is provided, then the<br />
simple <a href="DualDiscs" class="uri">DualDiscs</a> collision movie is used which is part of PTB.</p>
<p>timeOfEvent - Time (in seconds) when the timelocked event happens which<br />
should be detected by the subject. Default is time of contact of the<br />
<a href="DualDiscs" class="uri">DualDiscs</a> collision.</p>
<p>trials - Number of trials to run. Defaults to 10 or ESC key press.</p>
<p>How the demo works: Read the source code - its well documented ;-)<br />
This demo demonstrates the optimal way if you have movies with sound<br />
(that needs to be played in sync with the video) or long movies that<br />
don’t fit into memory or that you don’t want to load into memory.</p>
<p>It uses automatic synchronized audio-video playback. The central<br />
while-loop checks for arrival of new frames for display and displays them<br />
when their time has come. It also registers subjects keypress responses<br />
and does all the bookkeeping and sanity checking.</p>
<p>An alternative approach would be to preload the whole movie into textures:<br />
The whole movie gets read into PTB textures before start of trial. Then<br />
you show the textures in quick succession like in <a href="MovieDemo" class="uri">MovieDemo</a>. The<br />
advantage of that approach is exact control over display timing and<br />
display order: You can show frames in any order you like at any rate you<br />
like (and that your hardware likes). Disadvantage would be: Longer trial<br />
setup time for loading the whole movie, higher memory consumption (keep<br />
all n frames in memory instead of only the current one) and the inability<br />
to play sound in sync with video.</p>
