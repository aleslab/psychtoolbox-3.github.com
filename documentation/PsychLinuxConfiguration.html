<p><a href="PsychLinuxConfiguration" class="uri">PsychLinuxConfiguration</a>([answers]) – Optimize setup of Linux system.</p>
<p>This script modifies system settings and configuration files<br />
to optimize a Linux system for use with Psychtoolbox.</p>
<p>Currently it modifies files to allow to run Octave or Matlab<br />
as regular non-root user, ie. without need for root login or<br />
the “sudo” command. It does so by changing file permissions<br />
and resource usage limits to allow a regular user application<br />
to switch to realtime scheduling, lock its memory, and to<br />
access special purpose hardware like <a href="GPUs" class="uri">GPUs</a>, Bits+, Datapixx and<br />
other research equipment.</p>
<p>Realtime optimizations are achieved by extending the<br />
/etc/security/limits.conf file with entries that allow<br />
members of the Unix user group “psychtoolbox” to lock<br />
application memory into physical RAM, eliminating/minimizing<br />
interference from the VM subsystem, and to run with realtime<br />
priorities up to level 50. The group “psychtoolbox” is created<br />
if it does not already exist.</p>
<p>If the target system has a /etc/security/limits.d/ directory,<br />
then a separate rule file is stored to that directory to<br />
achieve the change without messing around with the limits.conf<br />
file.</p>
<p>root-less hardware access is achieved by copying a special<br />
psychtoolbox.rules file into the /etc/udev/rules.d/ directory.<br />
This udev rules file contains rules to auto-detect certain<br />
hardware at bootup or when the hw is hot-plugged and to<br />
reconfigure this hw or access permission for root-less access<br />
by Psychtoolbox, and for optimal performance for the kind<br />
of typical PTB use cases.</p>
<p>The script also creates a /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/ directory for<br />
xorg.conf configuration files which are writable by members<br />
of the ‘psychtoolbox’ group to allow easy reconfiguration of<br />
the X11 display system for running experiment sessions.</p>
<p>The script calls into the shell via “sudo” to achieve this<br />
setup task, which itself needs admin privileges to modify<br />
system files etc. “sudo” will prompt the user for his admin<br />
password to complete the tasks. This does not work on Octave<br />
with GUI though. You will need octave –no-gui to execute this<br />
script once if you use octave.</p>
<p>The script also checks if any special configuration is required<br />
to work around Linux specific <a href="OpenGL" class="uri">OpenGL</a> quirks of Matlab R2014b or<br />
later.</p>
