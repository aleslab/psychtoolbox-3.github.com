<p><a href="PlayMoviesWithoutGapDemo2" class="uri">PlayMoviesWithoutGapDemo2</a>(moviename)</p>
<p>This demo accepts a pattern for a valid moviename, e.g.,<br />
moviename=‘*.mpg’, then it plays all movies in the current working<br />
directory whose names match the provided pattern, e.g., the ‘*.mpg’<br />
pattern would play all MPEG files in the current directory.</p>
<p>Pressing ESC ends the demo.</p>
<p>Movies are played one after each other. We try to minimize perceptible<br />
gaps between end of movie i and start of movie i+1 by asynchronous<br />
loading: While movie i is played back, we ask Psychtoolbox to load the<br />
next movie i+1 in the background, so startup time for movie i+1 will be<br />
minimized.</p>
<p>This method uses only one ‘movie’ object for successive, gapless playback<br />
of many movie files. The advantage is simplicity in use and maximum<br />
quality in the sense that movies should play back-to-back without any<br />
significant delays between them. The downside is loss in flexibility.<br />
This method only works if all movies have exactly the same image size,<br />
color depth and format, aspect ratio and playback framerate. They may<br />
only differ in filename, content and duration. Any other difference will<br />
cause malfunctions, even hard crashes of Matlab or Octave!</p>
<p>If you need a method that is more flexible and can handle movies of<br />
different format, use the method in <a href="PlayMoviesWithoutGapDemo1" class="uri">PlayMoviesWithoutGapDemo1</a>. That<br />
method can handle arbitrary movies. The downside is a higher likelyhood<br />
of small gaps between movies.</p>
