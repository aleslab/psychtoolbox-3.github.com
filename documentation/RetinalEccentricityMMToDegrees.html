<p>eccMm = <a href="DegreesToRetinalEccentricityMM" class="uri">DegreesToRetinalEccentricityMM</a>(eccDegrees,[species],[method],[eyeLengthMm])</p>
<p>Convert eccentricity in degrees to retinal eccentricity in mm. By<br />
default, this takes into account a simple model eye, rather than just<br />
relying on a linear small angle approximation.</p>
<p>Input:<br />
eccDegrees – retinal eccentricity in degrees<br />
species – what species<br />
‘Human’ – Human eye [default]<br />
‘Rhesus’ – Rhesus monkey<br />
method – what method<br />
‘DaceyPeterson’ – formulae from Dacey &amp; Peterson (1992) [default]<br />
‘Linear’ – linear, based on small angle approx<br />
eyeLengthMm – Eye length to assume for linear calculation, should be<br />
the posterior nodal distance. Defaults to the default values returned<br />
by function <a href="EyeLength" class="uri">EyeLength</a> for the chosen species.</p>
<p>The Dacey and Peterson formulae are based on digitizing and fitting<br />
curves published by<br />
1) Drasdo and Fowler, 1974 (British J. Opthth, 58,pp. 709 ff., Figure 2,<br />
for human.<br />
2) Perry and Cowey (1985, Vision Reserch, 25, pp. 1795-1810, Figure 4,<br />
for rhesus monkey.<br />
These curves, I think, were produced by ray tracing or otherwise solving<br />
model eyes.</p>
<p>The default eye length returned by <a href="EyeLength" class="uri">EyeLength</a> for Human is currently the Rodiek value of<br />
16.1 mm. Drasdo and Fowler formulae are based on a length of about this,<br />
so the linear and <a href="DaceyPeterson" class="uri">DaceyPeterson</a> methods are roughly consistent for small<br />
angles. Similarly with the Rhesus default. Using other EyeLength’s will<br />
make the two methods inconsistent.</p>
<p>The Dacey and Peterson equations don’t go through (0,0), but rather<br />
produce a visual angle of 0.1 degree for an eccentricity of 0. This<br />
seems bad to me. I modified the formulae so that they use the linear<br />
approximation for small angles, producing a result that does go through<br />
(0,0). This may be related to the fact that there is some ambiguity in<br />
the papers between whether the center should be thought of as the fovea<br />
or the center of the optical axis. But I think this difference is small<br />
enough that the same formulae would apply across such a shift in origin.</p>
<p>I digitized Drasdo and Fowler Figure 2 and compared it to what<br />
<a href="DegreesToRetinalEccentricity" class="uri">DegreesToRetinalEccentricity</a> produces. I’d call agreement so-so, but<br />
considerably better than what the linear approximation produces. One<br />
could probably do better, but my intuition is that the deviations are<br />
small compared to eye to eye differences and differences that would be<br />
produced by different model eyes, so that juice isn’t worth the squeeze.<br />
I pasted my digitization at the end of <a href="DegreesToRetinalEccentricity" class="uri">DegreesToRetinalEccentricity</a> if<br />
anyone wants to fuss with this. But probably if you’re going to do that,<br />
you should do the whole ray tracing thing with our best current model<br />
eye.</p>
<p>I have not checked the fit to the Perrry and Cowey curve for Rhesus<br />
against a digitization of that figure.</p>
