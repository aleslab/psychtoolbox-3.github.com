[AudioTunnel3DDemo2](AudioTunnel3DDemo2) -- A very sketchy and raw demo of how to use [OpenAL](OpenAL) to  
create the illusion of walking through a tunnel which has different sound  
sources attached to it.  
  
You'll need a properly configured multi-speaker system or very good  
head-phones attached to a very good soundcard and a lot of luck and  
goodwill for this to sound good.  
  
[OpenAL](OpenAL) for Matlab is currently only supported on a subset of platforms,  
so this demo may abort quickly with an error.
