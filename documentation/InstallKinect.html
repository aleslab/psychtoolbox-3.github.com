<p><a href="InstallKinect" class="uri">InstallKinect</a> - Kinect driver installation instructions.</p>
<h1 id="ms-windows">MS-Windows</h1>
<p>Psychtoolbox on Windows currently only supports the original XBOX-360 Kinect,<br />
not the more recent versions of “Kinect for Windows”. Use GNU/Linux if you want<br />
to use those.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Unzip the file Psychtoolbox/<a href="PsychContributed" class="uri">PsychContributed</a>/Kinect-v16-<a href="WindowsDrivers" class="uri">WindowsDrivers</a>.zip<br />
into a temporary folder, e.g., C:[KinectDrivers](KinectDrivers).</p></li>
<li><p>Plug in your Kinect box into a USB port via the interface cable.</p></li>
<li><p>The Windows hardware setup assistant will start, tell you about new<br />
detected hardware and ask you for drivers. Say “No” to the<br />
“automatically search for drivers” option, but select to “provide your<br />
own drivers”. In the next tab, select “browse for drivers”, and then<br />
select the temporary folder with the unzipped file (from step 1) as<br />
driver folder. Press ok.</p></li>
<li><p>The driver will be installed from the zip file, the device manager<br />
will notifiy you of the new device, then prompt you for installation<br />
of another device. Repeat the same procedure from step 3 until no more<br />
devices need to be installed. This procedure will repeat three to four<br />
times until all drivers are installed, as the Kinect shows up as<br />
multiple separate devices (Video camera, Audio soundcard and<br />
Kinect motor).</p></li>
<li><p>The setup assistant will tell you that your new device is fully<br />
operational. Quit the assistant.</p></li>
<li><p>Unplug the Kinect, wait a few seconds, plug it in again, just to be<br />
sure it is correctly detected.</p></li>
<li><p>Now you can start Matlab or Octave and use the Kinect! Try <a href="KinectDemo" class="uri">KinectDemo</a><br />
and <a href="Kinect3DDemo" class="uri">Kinect3DDemo</a> for a start, then delve into your own Kinect adventures.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The current Kinect low level drivers are still early prototypes, so<br />
expect occassional bugs or weird behaviour.</p>
<h1 id="gnulinux">GNU/Linux</h1>
<p>If you use the Psychtoolbox distribution provided by the <a href="NeuroDebian" class="uri">NeuroDebian</a><br />
project (http://neuro.debian.net) there’s nothing to do. It should “just<br />
work(tm)”, well almost: Skip to step 2. Otherwise the following step 1<br />
is required:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>If you have Ubuntu Linux 10.04 LTS or later installed, open a terminal<br />
window and type this sequence of commands, providing your administrator<br />
password as requested. (Same procedure for Debian 4.0 or later)</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>Add the <a href="NeuroDebian" class="uri">NeuroDebian</a> repository to your software sources, as described<br />
at http://neuro.debian.net#how-to-use-this-repository<br />
</li>
<li>sudo apt-get update<br />
</li>
<li>sudo apt-get install freenect<br />
</li>
<li>sudo adduser YOURNAME video<br />
–&gt; (YOURNAME) is your user login name!<br />
</li>
<li>Log out and Log in again.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<p>For non-Debian or non-Ubuntu Linux distributions, you’ll need to install<br />
a version of libfreenect that is compatible to version 0.1.2 via whatever<br />
means your system provides to do this. If you want to also use the Kinect for<br />
Windows, instead of only the “original” XBOX-360 kinect, then you will need<br />
libfreenect version 0.2 or later. Using version 0.2 or later of libfreenect<br />
will also allow you to skip the following setup step 2:</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p>Kinect is now useable from within Matlab or Octave. Well almost.<br />
Systems with Linux kernel version 3.0 or later can use the video camera<br />
and microphones of the Kinect as regular sound and video devices, e.g.,<br />
for use by the Psychtoolbox videocapture and recording functions or other<br />
video apps (Skype, etc.). This however blocks use of the Kinect by our<br />
<a href="PsychKinect" class="uri">PsychKinect</a>() driver. If you want the Kinect as 3D depths camera with<br />
our driver or other Kinect-specific software, you need to disable the<br />
standard Linux kinect driver “gspca_kinect” by black-listing it. On<br />
Ubuntu Linux (and probably most other distributions) you can do this<br />
by copying the file linux_blacklist_kinectvideo from Psychtoolboxs<br />
<a href="PsychContributed" class="uri">PsychContributed</a> folder to Linux /etc/modprobe.d/ directory as a root<br />
user. This is most simply done by executing this function <a href="InstallKinect" class="uri">InstallKinect</a>,<br />
and blindly entering your password while logged in as a user with<br />
administrator rights (as the script calls the sudo command).</p></li>
<li><p>After this procedure, the Kinect should be fully useable by Psychtoolbox.</p></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="mac-osx">Mac OS/X</h1>
<p>See the OS/X section at http://openkinect.org/wiki/Getting_Started<br />
You will need libfreenect version 0.1.2 or compatible for this to work.</p>
<p>The easiest way to get these libraries on OSX is via Homebrew.<br />
Get it at: http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew</p>
<p>Once Homebrew is installed, one first needs to “brew install automake”,<br />
and “brew install autoconfig”, and potentially cmake before one can<br />
“brew install libfreenect”.</p>
<p>If you want to also use the Kinect for Windows, instead of only the<br />
“original” XBOX-360 kinect, then you will need libfreenect version 0.3 or<br />
later.</p>
<p><a href="PsychKinectCore" class="uri">PsychKinectCore</a> links dynamically against those two libraries. We don’t<br />
distribute them for now, as that would require us to distribute the<br />
corresponding source code of libusb-1.0.0 as well due to <a href="LGPLv2" class="uri">LGPLv2</a><br />
requirements.</p>
<h1 id="caveats">CAVEATS</h1>
<p>This is still early prototype software, expect bugs, bumps and hickups.</p>
<p>The Kinect driver has been successfully tested with “Microsoft <a href="XBox" class="uri">XBox</a><br />
Kinect”. This version doesn’t yet work with “Microsoft Kinect for<br />
Windows”, due to lack of support in the libfreenect-0.1.2 library.</p>

under different free software / open source licenses. The drivers are<br />
