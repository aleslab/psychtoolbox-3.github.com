[NVision3D](NVision3D) - Support for [NVidia](NVidia) [NVision](NVision) stereo goggles.  
  
Psychtoolbox supports use of USB driven stereo shutter glasses from  
NVidia's [NVision](NVision) stereo kit. The support for USB is currently limited to  
64-Bit Linux systems, ie., 64-Bit Octave and 64-Bit Matlab on Linux.  
  
If you want to drive such shutter glasses via a suitable [NVidia](NVidia) Quadro  
series GPU or AMD Fire series GPU that has a 3-Pin-Mini-DIN stereo output  
connector then you can simply connect the stereo emitter to that  
connector, setup your graphics card for it, and select stereomode 1 in  
Psychtoolbox.  
  
If you want to drive such shutter glasses via any graphics card from any  
vendor via the USB connector, then you will have to select stereomode 11  
in your scripts and perform the following setup steps beforehand. This  
functionality is currently limited to 64-Bit Linux only, and highly  
experimental in nature, without any guarantees that this will work  
reliably - or at all - for you.  
  
Use of USB driven stereo goggles is enabled by use of the LGPL licensed  
open-source library nvstusb from ...  
<http://sourceforge.net/projects/libnvstusb\> ... thank you!  
A copy of the libraries source code can be found in the  
[PsychSourceGL](PsychSourceGL)/Cohorts/libnvstusb-code-32/ subfolder or the original code  
in the libnvstusb-code-32.zip file in that folder. See "help  
[UseTheSource](UseTheSource)" on how to get the [PsychSourceGL](PsychSourceGL) folder with Psychtoolbox  
source code.  
  
  
### Setup steps:  
  
1. Run [PsychLinuxConfiguration](PsychLinuxConfiguration) if you installed PTB from your  
   Linux distributions package manager, or from [NeuroDebian](NeuroDebian). If you  
   installed via [DownloadPsychtoolbox](DownloadPsychtoolbox) or [UpdatePsychtoolbox](UpdatePsychtoolbox),  
   [PsychLinuxConfiguration](PsychLinuxConfiguration) will have been executed for you already. Make  
   sure to answer with yes when the function asks you for approval to  
   update the udev rules file.  
  
2. Reboot your machine.  
  
3. Connect the stereo emitter to a suitable USB port.  
  
4. Get the nvstusb.fw file from somewhere. You can find it either  
   on the Internet via a Google search, or you can use the  
   nvstusb-extractfw tool in the Psychtoolbox/[PsychHardware](PsychHardware) folder from a  
   terminal window. It needs to be pointed to a file of the installed  
   [NVidia](NVidia) stereo driver for Microsoft Windows, which obviously requires  
   you to have a working MS-Windows installation with a [NVidia](NVidia) card.  
   Alternatively follow the instructions about generating nvstusb.fw from  
   this website: <http://nvstusb.gnu-log.net/\>  
  
5. Copy the nvstusb.fw file into your home directory, e.g., if your  
   user name is mathilde: /home/mathilde/nvstusb.fw or even better into  
   the Psychtoolbox configuration directory, e.g.,  
   /home/mathilde/.Psychtoolbox/nvstusb.fw  
  
6. You should be set. Run, e.g., [StereoDemo](StereoDemo)(11) or [ImagingStereoDemo](ImagingStereoDemo)(11).
