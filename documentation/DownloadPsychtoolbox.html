<p><a href="DownloadPsychtoolbox" class="uri">DownloadPsychtoolbox</a>([targetdirectory][, flavor][, targetRevision])</p>
<p>This script downloads the latest GNU/Linux, Mac OSX, or MS-Windows<br />
Psychtoolbox-3, version 3.0.10 or later, from our git-server to your<br />
disk, creating your working copy, ready to use as a new toolbox in your<br />
MATLAB/OCTAVE application. Subject to your permission, any old<br />
installation of the Psychtoolbox is first removed. It’s a careful<br />
program, checking for all required resources and privileges before it<br />
starts.</p>
<p>Note: If you use a Debian derived Linux distribution, e.g., Debian or<br />
Ubuntu, consider installing the package octave-psychtoolbox-3 or<br />
matlab-psychtoolbox-3 instead from http://neuro.debian.net - This is more<br />
convenient and will provide you with automatic updates.</p>
<p>CAUTION: Psychtoolbox 3.0.13 will not work anymore with 32-Bit Octave-4<br />
on MS-Windows, or with OSX versions earlier than 10.10 “Yosemite”.<br />
Psychtoolbox will likely work with versions of Microsoft Windows older<br />
than Windows-10, but it is not tested on such systems anymore and not<br />
supported at all on Windows versions earlier than Windows-7. For best<br />
compatibility you should probably use Windows-10 with all upgrades<br />
installed.</p>
<p>CAUTION: Psychtoolbox 3.0.12 will not work anymore with 32-Bit Matlab, or<br />
with OSX versions earlier than 10.8 “Mountain Lion”. Psychtoolbox may<br />
work with versions of Microsoft Windows older than Windows-7, but it is<br />
not tested or supported on such ancient Windows systems anymore, so use<br />
at your own risk.</p>
<p>Psychtoolbox 3.0.11 *will not work* with GNU/Octave on MS-Windows, or<br />
with 32-Bit Octave on OSX, as support for these setups has been cancelled<br />
for the 3.0.10 series. It will also not work with 32-Bit Matlab on OSX,<br />
or with OSX versions earlier than 10.6.8 “Snow Leopard”, unless you<br />
choose the unsupported legacy flavor “Psychtoolbox-3.0.10” via the<br />
optional ‘flavor’ parameter.</p>
<p>If you want to download older versions of Psychtoolbox than 3.0.10, e.g.,<br />
version 3.0.9, use the <a href="DownloadLegacyPsychtoolbox" class="uri">DownloadLegacyPsychtoolbox</a>() function instead of<br />
this function.</p>
<p>On Mac OSX, all parameters are optional. On MS-Windows and GNU/Linux, the<br />
first parameter “targetdirectory” with the path to the installation<br />
target directory is required. The “targetdirectory” name may not contain<br />
any white space, otherwise download will fail with mysterious error<br />
messages!</p>
<p>On OSX, your working copy of the Psychtoolbox will be placed in either<br />
your /Applications or your /Users/Shared folder (depending on permissions<br />
and your preference), or you may specify a ‘targetdirectory’, as you<br />
prefer.</p>
<p>On Microsoft Windows, you must specify the full path, including<br />
the drive name where Psychtoolbox should be installed, e.g.,<br />
’C:[MyToolboxes](MyToolboxes)'.</p>
<p>The desired flavor of a Psychtoolbox release can be selected via the<br />
optional “flavor” parameter: By default, ‘beta’ (aka ‘current’) will be<br />
installed if you don’t specify otherwise, as this is almost always the<br />
best possible choice. You may be able to download an old versioned<br />
release via a namestring like ‘Psychtoolbox-x.y.z’, e.g.,<br />
‘Psychtoolbox-3.0.7’ if you’d want to download version 3.0.7. This is<br />
only useful if you run a very old operating system or Matlab version that<br />
isn’t supported by the current “beta” anymore, so you’d need to stick<br />
with an old versioned release.</p>
<p>Normally your download should just work(TM). Very infrequently, the<br />
download servers may be overloaded or down for maintenance, resulting in<br />
download failure. In that case, please retry a few hours later.</p>
<p>The “targetRevision” argument is optional and should be normally omitted.<br />
Normal behaviour is to download the latest revision of Psychtoolbox. If<br />
you provide a specific targetRevision, then this script will install a<br />
copy of Psychtoolbox according to the specified revision.</p>
<p>This is only useful if you experience problems and want to revert to an<br />
earlier known-to-be-good release.</p>
<p>Revisions can be specified by a revision number or by the special flag<br />
‘PREV’ which will choose the revision before the most current one.</p>
<p>INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS: The Wiki contains much more up to date<br />
instructions. If in doubt, follow instructions on the Wiki!</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>If you don’t already have it, you must install the Subversion client.<br />
For Mac OSX 10.6 and later, download the latest Mac OSX Subversion client<br />
from: http://www.wandisco.com/subversion/download#osx<br />
If you have the <a href="XCode" class="uri">XCode</a> command line tools installed, you won’t need to<br />
install subversion as it is included in these tools.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="for-windows-download-the-windows-subversion-client-from-one-of-these">For Windows, download the Windows Subversion client from one of these:</h3>
<p>http://subversion.apache.org/packages.html#windows<br />
http://www.wandisco.com/subversion/download#windows</p>
<p>Install the Subversion client on your machine by double-clicking the<br />
installer and following the instructions. After installation of the<br />
Subversion client, you will need to exit and restart Matlab or Octave, so<br />
it can find the new subversion executable. In many cases it may be<br />
neccessary to even reboot your computer after installation of subversion.<br />
Btw. you should avoid to install the client into a path that contains<br />
blanks/spaces/white-space as this can lead to download failures in some<br />
cases, e.g., ‘C:Files...’ may be bad because there is a blank<br />
between the “Program” and “Files”.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if you don’t have the neccessary permissions to install<br />
Subversion into a system folder, you can install Subversion into an<br />
arbitrary folder on your system (excluding ones with blanks in their<br />
path) and then add that folder to your Matlab or Octave path. E.g. you<br />
installed into D:[MyOwnFolder](MyOwnFolder) . Then you can do this:<br />
addpath(’D:[MyOwnFolder](MyOwnFolder)'). Our installer should find the<br />
client then.</p>
<p>For Linux, just install the subversion package from your package<br />
management tool.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>On <a href="MacOS" class="uri">MacOS</a>/X, to install the Psychtoolbox in the default location<br />
(/Applications or, failing that, /Users/Shared). Just type:</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="DownloadPsychtoolbox" class="uri">DownloadPsychtoolbox</a></p>
<p>Our standard option is in the Applications folder, but note that, as with<br />
installation of any software, you’ll need administrator privileges. Also<br />
note that if you put the toolbox in the Applications folder, you’ll need<br />
to reinstall it when MATLAB / OCTAVE is updated on your machine. If you<br />
must install without access to an administrator, we offer the option of<br />
installing into the /Users/Shared/ folder instead. If you must install<br />
the Psychtoolbox in some other folder, then specify it in the optional<br />
first argument of your call.</p>
<p>On Windows or Linux, provide a pathname, e.g.:<br />
<a href="DownloadPsychtoolbox" class="uri">DownloadPsychtoolbox</a>(’C:[MyToolboxes](MyToolboxes)');</p>
<p>That’s it. Any pre-existing installation of the Psychtoolbox will be<br />
removed (if you approve). The program will then download the latest<br />
Psychtoolbox and update your MATLAB / OCTAVE path and other relevant<br />
system settings.</p>
<p>Enjoy! If you’re new to this, you might start by typing “help<br />
Psychtoolbox”.</p>
<p>P.S. If you get stuck, first check the FAQ section and Download section<br />
of our Wiki at http://www.psychtoolbox.org. If that doesn’t help, post<br />

<p>Please specify your full name and the version of your operating system,<br />
MATLAB / OCTAVE, and psychtoolbox.</p>
<h3 id="upgrade-instructions">UPGRADE INSTRUCTIONS:</h3>
<p>To upgrade your copy of Psychtoolbox, at any time, to incorporate the<br />
latest bug fixes, enhancements, and new features, just type:<br />
<a href="UpdatePsychtoolbox" class="uri">UpdatePsychtoolbox</a></p>
<p><a href="UpdatePsychtoolbox" class="uri">UpdatePsychtoolbox</a> cannot change the flavor of your Psychtoolbox. To<br />
change the flavor, run <a href="DownloadPsychtoolbox" class="uri">DownloadPsychtoolbox</a> to completely discard your<br />
old installation and get a fresh copy with the requested flavor.</p>
<h3 id="permissions">PERMISSIONS:</h3>
<p>There’s a thorny issue with permissions on OS/X. It may not be possible<br />
to install into /Applications (or whatever the targetdirectory is) with<br />
the user’s existing privileges. The normal situation on Mac OSX is that a<br />
few users have “administrator” privileges, and many don’t. By default,<br />
writing to the /Applications folder requires administrator privileges.</p>
<p><a href="DownloadPsychtoolbox" class="uri">DownloadPsychtoolbox</a> creates the Psychtoolbox folder with permissions set<br />
to allow writing by everyone. Our hope is that this will allow updating<br />
(by <a href="UpdatePsychtoolbox">UpdatePsychtoolbox)</a>) without need for administrator privileges.</p>
<p>Some labs that may want to be able to install without access to an<br />
administrator. For them we offer the fall back of installing Psychtoolbox<br />
in /Users/Shared/, instead of /Applications/, because, by default,<br />
/Users/Shared/ is writeable by all users.</p>
<h3 id="savepath">SAVEPATH</h3>
<p>Normally all users of MATLAB / OCTAVE use the same path. This path is<br />
normally saved in MATLABROOT/toolbox/local/pathdef.m, where “MATLABROOT”<br />
stands for the result returned by running that function in MATLAB, e.g.<br />
‘/Applications/MATLAB.app/Contents/Matlab14.1’. Since pathdef.m is inside<br />
the MATLAB package, which is normally in the Applications folder,<br />
ordinary users (not administrators) cannot write to pathdef.m. They’ll<br />
get an error message whenever they try to save the path, e.g. by typing<br />
“savepath”. Most users will find this an unacceptable limitation. The<br />
solution is very simple, ask an administrator to use File Get Info to set<br />
the pathdef.m file permissions to allow write by everyone. This needs to<br />
be done only once, after installing MATLAB.</p>
