<p>Start playback of movie associated with movieobject ‘moviePtr’. ‘rate’ defines<br />
the desired playback rate: 0 == Stop playback, 1 == Normal speed forward, -1 ==<br />
Normal speed backward, … . Not all movie files allow reverse playback or<br />
playback at other rates than normal speed forward. ‘loop’ Enable looped playback<br />
if set to a value greater than zero. A value of 1 will enable repetitive looped<br />
playback with the default strategy, or the special strategy selected via the<br />
optional ‘specialFlags1’ settings provided during the call to<br />
<a href="Screen" class="uri">Screen</a>(‘OpenMovie’, …). Values greater than 1 select different repetition<br />
strategies when combined together. Different strategies exist to handle<br />
different quirks with some movie file formats and encodings and with some<br />
versions of [<a href="GStreamer" class="uri">GStreamer</a>][(GStreamer)]((GStreamer)): A flag of 2 requests looped playback via gapless<br />
reloading of the movie instead of rewinding it to the start. A flag of 1+4 uses<br />
so called segment seeks for rewinding, whereas adding 8 (e.g., 1+8 or 1+4+8)<br />
asks to flush the video pipeline during rewinding. Your mileage with these<br />
looping strategies will differ, but usually the default settings are good enough<br />
for most purposes. There are however movie files or network video streams that<br />
can’t be automatically repeated at all, so called non-seekable streams.<br />
‘soundvolume’ Select the output audio volume of an associated soundtrack: 0 =<br />
Mute sound output, 0.01 - 1.0 Volume in percent. You can choose the sound volume<br />
with low overhead while playback is active by calling this function, as long as<br />
you provide the same parameters for all other settings as the ones you used when<br />
starting playback, ie. only ‘soundvolume’ may differ.<br />
If the function is called to stop playback, it will return the number of frames<br />
that needed to be dropped in order to keep video playback in sync with realtime<br />
and audio playback. Otherwise it returns zero.</p>
