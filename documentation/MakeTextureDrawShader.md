glsl = [MakeTextureDrawShader](MakeTextureDrawShader)(windowPtr, shadertype [, backgroundColorOffset = [0,0,0,0]]);  
  
Create a special GLSL shader that can apply some special image processing  
operations that modify the normal drawing of textures via  
[Screen](Screen)('DrawTexture(s)'). Return a handle 'glsl' to the shader.  
  
The created shader can be attached to specific textures via passing the  
returned 'glsl' argument as the optional 'textureShader' argument for the  
[Screen](Screen)('MakeTexture', ....., textureShader); function. It can be also  
applied on a per-draw basis by passing the 'glsl' handle as optional  
'textureShader' argument to the [Screen](Screen)('DrawTexture(s)', ...); function.  
  
  
### Mandatory arguments:  
  
'windowPtr' A handle to the onscreen window to which the shader should be  
associated.  
  
'shadertype' A name string that defines the type of shader / image  
processing operation to apply. It can be one of the following:  
  
- 'SeparateAlphaChannel': Alpha values are looked up at the regular  
locations defined via the 'srcRect' parameter in a [Screen](Screen)('DrawTexture')  
call. RGB color values are looked up at srcRect, offset by some (dx,dy)  
offset, and (dx2,dy2) offset, as provided by the 'auxParameters' vector  
[dx, dy, dx2, dy2].  
Providing non-zero offset values for dx and dy allows to "shift" or  
"scroll" the RGB or Luminance image inside a texture during drawing,  
while keeping the alpha image at a fixed location, solely defined by  
'srcRect'. This is mostly useful if you want to draw some drifting  
stimulus with a fixed alpha channel mask applied, ie., the color image  
should move, but the alpha mask should stay fixed. The (dx2,dy2) offsets  
allow to apply some offset before applying rotations, again only to the  
color channels, not the alpha channel.  
  
- 'PremultipliedAlphaChannel': Like 'SeparateAlphaChannel', but the alpha  
value is not written to the framebuffer, but premultiplied to the RGB  
color pixel before writeout.  
  
'backgroundColorOffset' Optional, defaults to [0 0 0 0]. A RGBA offset  
color to add to the final RGBA colors of the drawn texture, prior to  
drawing it.
