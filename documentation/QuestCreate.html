<p>q=<a href="QuestCreate" class="uri">QuestCreate</a>(tGuess,tGuessSd,pThreshold,beta,delta,gamma,[grain],[range],[plotIt])</p>
<p>Create a struct q with all the information necessary to measure<br />
threshold. Threshold “t” is measured on an abstract “intensity”<br />
scale, which usually corresponds to log10 contrast.</p>
<p><a href="QuestCreate" class="uri">QuestCreate</a> saves in struct q the parameters for a Weibull psychometric function:<br />
p2=delta*gamma+(1-delta)*(1-(1-gamma)*exp(-10.^(beta*(x-xThreshold))));<br />
where x represents log10 contrast relative to threshold. The Weibull<br />
function itself appears only in <a href="QuestRecompute" class="uri">QuestRecompute</a>, which uses the<br />
specified parameter values in q to compute a psychometric function<br />
and store it in q. All the other Quest functions simply use the<br />
psychometric function stored in “q”. <a href="QuestRecompute" class="uri">QuestRecompute</a> is called solely<br />
by <a href="QuestCreate" class="uri">QuestCreate</a> and <a href="QuestBetaAnalysis" class="uri">QuestBetaAnalysis</a> (and possibly by a few user<br />
programs). Thus, if you prefer to use a different kind of<br />
psychometric function, called Foo, you need only create your own<br />
<a href="QuestCreateFoo" class="uri">QuestCreateFoo</a>, <a href="QuestRecomputeFoo" class="uri">QuestRecomputeFoo</a>, and (if you need it)<br />
<a href="QuestBetaAnalysisFoo" class="uri">QuestBetaAnalysisFoo</a>, based on <a href="QuestCreate" class="uri">QuestCreate</a>, <a href="QuestRecompute" class="uri">QuestRecompute</a>, and<br />
<a href="QuestBetaAnalysis" class="uri">QuestBetaAnalysis</a>, and you can use them with the rest of the Quest<br />
package unchanged. You would only be changing a few lines of code,<br />
so it would quite easy to do.</p>
<p>Several users of Quest have asked questions on the Psychtoolbox forum<br />
about how to restrict themselves to a practical testing range. That is<br />
not what tGuessSd and “range” are for; they should be large, e.g. I<br />
typically set tGuessSd=3 and range=5 when intensity represents log<br />
contrast. If necessary, you should restrict the range yourself, outside<br />
of Quest. Here, in <a href="QuestCreate" class="uri">QuestCreate</a>, you tell Quest about your prior beliefs,<br />
and you should try to be open-minded, giving Quest a generously large<br />
range to consider as possible values of threshold. For each trial you<br />
will later ask Quest to suggest a test intensity. It is important to<br />
realize that what Quest returns is just what you asked for, a<br />
suggestion. You should then test at whatever intensity you like, taking<br />
into account both the suggestion and any practical constraints (e.g. a<br />
maximum and minimum contrast that you can achieve, and quantization of<br />
contrast). After running the trial you should call <a href="QuestUpdate" class="uri">QuestUpdate</a> with the<br />
contrast that you actually used and the observer’s response to add your<br />
new datum to the database. Don’t restrict “tGuessSd” or “range” by the<br />
limitations of what you can display. Keep open the possibility that<br />
threshold may lie outside the range of contrasts that you can produce,<br />
and let Quest consider all possibilities.</p>
<p>There is one exception to the above advice of always being generous with<br />
tGuessSd. Occasionally we find that we have a working Quest-based<br />
program that measures threshold, and we discover that we need to measure<br />
the proportion correct at a particular intensity. Instead of writing a<br />
new program, or modifying the old one, it is often more convenient to<br />
instead reduce tGuessSd to practically zero, e.g. a value like 0.001,<br />
which has the effect of restricting all threshold estimates to be<br />
practically identical to tGuess, making it easy to run any number of<br />
trials at that intensity. Of course, in this case, the final threshold<br />
estimate from Quest should be ignored, since it is merely parroting back<br />
to you the assertion that threshold is equal to the initial guess<br />
“tGuess”. What’s of interest is the final proportion correct; at the<br />
end, call <a href="QuestTrials" class="uri">QuestTrials</a> or add an FPRINTF statement to report it.</p>
<p>tGuess is your prior threshold estimate.<br />
tGuessSd is the standard deviation you assign to that guess. Be generous.<br />
pThreshold is your threshold criterion expressed as probability of<br />
response==1. An intensity offset is introduced into the psychometric<br />
function so that threshold (i.e. the midpoint of the table) yields<br />
pThreshold.<br />
beta, delta, and gamma are the parameters of a Weibull psychometric function.<br />
beta controls the steepness of the psychometric function. Typically 3.5.<br />
delta is the fraction of trials on which the observer presses blindly.<br />
Typically 0.01.<br />
gamma is the fraction of trials that will generate response 1 when<br />
intensity==-inf.<br />
grain is the quantization (step size) of the internal table. E.g. 0.01.<br />
range is the intensity difference between the largest and smallest<br />
intensity that the internal table can store. E.g. 5. This interval will<br />
be centered on the initial guess tGuess,<br />
i.e. tGuess+(-range/2:grain:range/2). “range” is used only momentarily here,<br />
to determine “dim”, which is retained in the quest struct. “dim” is the<br />
number of distinct intensities that the internal table can store,<br />
e.g. 500. QUEST assumes that intensities outside of this interval have zero<br />
prior probability, i.e. they are impossible values for threshold. The<br />
cost of making “range” too big is some extra storage and computation,<br />
which are usually negligible. The cost of making “range” too small is<br />
that you prejudicially exclude what are actually possible values for<br />
threshold. Getting out-of-range warnings from <a href="QuestUpdate" class="uri">QuestUpdate</a> is one<br />
possible indication that your stated range is too small.</p>
