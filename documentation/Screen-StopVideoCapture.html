<p>Stop video capture device specified by ‘capturePtr’. The function returns the<br />
number of captured frames it had to drop from its internal buffers in order to<br />
keep synchronization with realtime or because it ran out of internal buffer<br />
space.<br />
If the optional ‘discardFrames’ flag is set to zero, then captured but not yet<br />
fetched video images will not get deleted. Instead they are retained until next<br />
time ‘StartVideoCapture’ is called. This allows to fetch them after capture has<br />
been stopped. By default, all pending frames are deleted at stop of capture<br />
(discardFrames == 1).</p>
