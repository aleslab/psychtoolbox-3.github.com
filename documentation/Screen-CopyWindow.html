<p>Copy images, quickly, between two windows (on- or off- screen).<br />
Content from onscreen windows is copied from the onscreen windows back buffer,<br />
or the onscreen windows draw buffer if the imaging pipeline is enabled, but<br />
never from the onscreen windows front buffer.<br />
srcRect and dstRect are set to the size of windows srcWindowPtr and dstWindowPtr<br />
by default. [copyMode] is accepted as input but currently ignored.<br />
<a href="CopyWindow" class="uri">CopyWindow</a> is mostly here for compatibility to PTB-2. If you want to copy images<br />
really quickly, use the ‘MakeTexture’ and ‘DrawTexture’ commands. They also<br />
allow for rotated drawing and advanced blending operations.<br />
The current <a href="CopyWindow" class="uri">CopyWindow</a> implementation has a couple of restrictions on old<br />
graphics cards, which may not apply anymore on modern cards:<br />
One can’t copy from an offscreen window into the -same- offscreen window.<br />
One can’t copy from an onscreen window into a -different- onscreen window.<br />
Sizes of sourceRect and targetRect need to match for Onscreen-&gt;Offscreen copy.</p>
