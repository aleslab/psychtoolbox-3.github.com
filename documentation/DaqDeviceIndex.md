daq = [DaqDeviceIndex](DaqDeviceIndex)([[DeviceName](DeviceName)][, [ShowInterfaceNumberWarning](ShowInterfaceNumberWarning)=1])  
Returns a list of all your USB -1024LS, -1208FS, -1408FS, or -1608FS daqs.  
  
CAUTION: This routine works well on GNU/Linux and MS-Windows, but is very  
unreliable on Apple OSX, especially with multiple DAQ devices connected.  
You may be better off guessing a proper daq index.  
  
TECHNICAL NOTE: When we call [PsychHID](PsychHID)('Devices'), each USB-1208FS/1408FS  
box presents itself as four HID "devices" sharing the same serial number. They  
are interfaces 0,1,2,3. They usually appear in reverse order in the  
device list. Nearly all the commands use only interface 0, so  
we will select that one to represent the whole. All our Daq routines  
expect to receive just the interface 0 device as a passed designator. The  
few routines that need to access the other interfaces do so  
automatically.  
  
ADDENDUM: The above statement is correct for the 1208FS and the 1408FS,  
not for the 1608FS. Number of Devices found by [PsychHID](PsychHID) for a  
1608FS and Leopard varies from five to seven with little rhyme or reason.  It  
appears that the correct number of interfaces is seven.  As with the 1208FS,  
most communication is through interface 0.  However, when acquiring data  
(e.g., using [DaqAInScan)](DaqAInScan)), output is via interfaces 1 through 6.  Because  
PsychHID's enumeration of the interfaces is flaky, you may need to run this  
function more than once (with calls to [DaqReset](DaqReset) and probably "clear [PsychHID](PsychHID)"  
in between successive calls) in order to get device enumeration completed  
correctly.  In [DaqTest](DaqTest), user will be warned if they try to test a 1608 and  
this function doesn't return the right number of interfaces, so I added the  
second optional argument as a flag to suppress the warning that would be  
generated here. -- mpr
