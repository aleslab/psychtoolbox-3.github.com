[T\_quantalAbsorptionsNormalized,T\_quantalAbsorptions,T\_quantalIsomerizations,adjIndDiffParams] = [ComputeRawConeFundamentals](ComputeRawConeFundamentals)(params,staticParams)  
  
Function to compute normalized cone quantal sensitivities from underlying  
pieces and parameters.  
  
Note that this routine returns quantal sensitivities.  You may want  
energy sensitivities.  In that case, use [EnergyToQuanta](EnergyToQuanta) to convert  
  T\_energy = [EnergyToQuanta](EnergyToQuanta)(S,T\_quantal')'  
and then renormalize.  (You call [EnergyToQuanta](EnergyToQuanta) because you're converting  
sensitivities, which go the opposite direction from spectra.)  
  
The routine also returns two types of quantal sensitivity functions.  The  
first gives the probability that a photon will be absorbed.  These are  
returned in variable T\_quantalAbsorptionsNormalized and  
T\_quantalAbsorptions, with the first being normalized. The second is the  
probability that the photon will cause a photopigment isomerization. This  
is returned in T\_quantalIsomerizations.  
  
It is T\_quantalIsomerizations that you want to use to compute  
isomerization rates from retinal illuminance. See note at the end of  
function [FillInPhotoreceptors](FillInPhotoreceptors) for some information about conventions.  In  
particular, this routine takes pre-retinal absorption into account in its  
computation of probability of absorptions and isomerizations, so that the  
relevant retinal illuminance is one computed without accounting for those  
factors.  This routine does not account for light attenuation due to the  
pupil, however.  The only use of pupil size here is becuase of its slight  
effect on lens density as accounted for in the CIE standard.  Nor does it  
account for the collecting area of a photoreceptor, for cones the inner  
segment diameter.  
  
In the passed params structure, you can either pass the lambdaMax values  
for the photopigment, in which case the absorbance is computed from the  
specified nomogram, or you can pass the absorbance values directly in  
T\_xxx format.  A typical choice in this case would be  
10.^T\_log10coneabsorbance\_ss for the Stockman-Sharpe/CIE estimates.  
  
The typical use of this function is to be called by  
[ComputeCIEConeFundamentals](ComputeCIEConeFundamentals), which sets up the passed structures acording  
to the CIE standard. This routine, however, could in principle be used  
with a wide variety of choices of the component pieces.  
  
The other place this function is used is in attempts to fit a set of cone  
fundamentals by doing parameter search over the pieces.  It is this  
second use that led to the parameters being split over two separate  
structures, one that is held static during the fit and the other which  
contains the parameters that could be searched over by a calling routine.  
For examples, see:  
  [FitConeFundamentalsWithNomogram](FitConeFundamentalsWithNomogram), [FitConeFundamentalsTest](FitConeFundamentalsTest).  
Looking around today (8/10/13), I (DHB) don't see any examples where this  
routine is called directly.  Rather, it is a subfunction called by  
[ComputeCIEConeFundamentals](ComputeCIEConeFundamentals).  The search routines above use  
[ComputeCIEConeFundamentals](ComputeCIEConeFundamentals), and only search over lambdaMax values.  I  
think I wrote this with the thought that I might one day search over more  
parameters, but lost motivation to carry it throught.  
  
The computations done here are very similar to those done in routine  
[FillInPhotoreceptors](FillInPhotoreceptors).  I (DHB) think that I forgot about what  
[FillInPhotoreceptors](FillInPhotoreceptors) could do when I wrote this, which has led to some  
redundancy. [FillInPhotoreceptors](FillInPhotoreceptors) returns a field called  
effectiveAbsorptance, which are the actual quantal efficiencies (not  
normalized) referred to the cornea.  [FillInPhotoceptors](FillInPhotoceptors) also computes a  
field isomerizationAbsorptance, which takes the quantal efficiency of  
isomerizations (probability of an isomerization given an absorption into  
acount.  
  
It would probably be clever to unify the two sets of routines a little  
more, but we may never get to it.  The routine [ComputeCIEConeFundamentals](ComputeCIEConeFundamentals)  
does contain a check that this routine and what is returned by  
[FillInPhotoreceptors](FillInPhotoreceptors) agree with each other, for cases where the  
parameters match.  
  
See [ComputeCIEConeFundamentals](ComputeCIEConeFundamentals) for the breakdown of how the Asano et al.  
(2016) individual differences model is specified in params.indDiffParams.  
  
See [ComputeCIEConeFundamentals](ComputeCIEConeFundamentals) for documentation of the adjIndDiffParams  
output argument.
