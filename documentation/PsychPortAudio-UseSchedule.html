<h2 id="psychtoolbox-psychportaudio.mexdll-subfunction">[[Psychtoolbox]] › [[PsychPortAudio]].{mex*,dll} subfunction</h2>
<p>Enable or disable use of a preprogrammed schedule for audio playback on audio<br />
device ‘pahandle’.<br />
Schedules are similar to playlists on your favorite audio player. A schedule<br />
allows to define a sequence of distinct sounds to play in succession. When<br />
<a href="PsychPortAudio" class="uri">PsychPortAudio</a>(‘Start’) is called, processing of the schedule begins and the<br />
first programmed sound snippet is played, followed by the 2nd, 3rd, … until<br />
the whole schedule has been played once and playback stops. You can add new<br />
sound snippets to the schedule while playback is running for uninterrupted<br />
playback of long sequences of sound.<br />
Each sound snippet or slot in the schedule defines a soundbuffer to play back<br />
via a ‘bufferhandle’, within the buffer a subsegment (a so called playloop)<br />
defined by start- and endpoint, and a number of repetitions for that playloop.<br />
This subfunction allows to either enable use of schedules by setting the<br />
‘enableSchedule’ flag to 1, in which case a schedule with a maximum of ‘maxSize’<br />
distinct slots is created (‘maxSize’ defaults to 128 slots), or to disable use<br />
of schedules by setting ‘enableSchedule’ to 0, in which case <a href="PsychPortAudio" class="uri">PsychPortAudio</a><br />
reverts back to its normal playback behaviour and an existing schedule is<br />
deleted.<br />
A ‘enableSchedule’ setting of 2 will reset an existing schedule, ie. clear it of<br />
all its entries, so it is ready to be rewritten with new entries. You should<br />
reset and rewrite a schedule each time after playback/processing of a schedule<br />
has finished or has been stopped.<br />
A ‘enableSchedule’ setting of 3 will reactivate an existing schedule, ie.<br />
prepare it for a replay.<br />
See the subfunction ‘AddToSchedule’ on how to populate the schedule with actual<br />
entries.</p>
