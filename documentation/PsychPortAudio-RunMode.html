<p>Set general run mode to ‘runMode’ and/or return old runMode for a device<br />
‘pahandle’.<br />
The device must be open for this setting to take effect and playback must be<br />
stopped if one wants to change the setting. If playback isn’t stopped, it will<br />
be forcefully stopped. Change of runMode is not supported on slave devices. The<br />
current/old runMode is returned in the optional return value ‘oldRunMode’.<br />
‘runMode’ is the optional new runmode: At device open time, the runMode defaults<br />
to one. In mode zero, the audio hardware and all internal processing are<br />
completely stopped at end of audio playback. This reduces system ressource usage<br />
(both hardware and computation time), but may cause slightly longer latencies<br />
when re’Start’ing the device for playback of a different sound, e.g., a sequence<br />
of sounds. In ‘runMode’ 1, the audio hardware and processing don’t shut down at<br />
the end of audio playback. Instead, everything remains active in a ‘’hot<br />
standby’’ state. This allows to very quickly (with low latency) restart sound<br />
playback via the ‘RescheduleStart’ function. The downside is a permanent use of<br />
system ressources even if no sound is playing. Future runMode settings may<br />
provide more interesting options, stay tuned…</p>
