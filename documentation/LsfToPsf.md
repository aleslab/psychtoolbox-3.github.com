[LSFToPSF](LSFToPSF)  Convert a line spread function to a point spread function.  
   psf = LSFTOPSF(lsf,varargin)  
  
   This works by taking the lsf into the one-dimensional frequency domain  
   (i.e. get the 1D MTF) and then creating a circularly symmetric version  
   of this.  The 2D frequency representation is then converted back to the  
   spatial domain to produce the psf.  This produces a spatially-symmetric  
   PSF consistent with the measured line spread function.  
  
   This method is described by Marchand, 1964, JOSA, 54, 7, pp. 915-919  
   and is one of several methods provided.  In 1964, taking the Fourier  
   transform was computationally intense.   
  
   There is a second paper by Marchand (1965, JOSA, 55, 4, 352-354) which  
   treats the more general case where you have line spread functions for  
   many orientations and want to recover an psf that is not necessarily  
   spatially-symmetric.  
  
   The lsf must be spatially symmetric.  This makes sense given that we  
   are going to recover a spatially symmetric psf.  
  
   You want to make sure that the spatial suport is large enough to  
   capture the full lsf.  
  
   The returned psf is normalized to have unit volume.
