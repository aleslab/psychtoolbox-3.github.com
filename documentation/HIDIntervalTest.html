<p><a href="HIDIntervalTest" class="uri">HIDIntervalTest</a> – Illustrate human interface device sampling interval.</p>
<p>The routine queries first the keyboard, later on the mouse buttons for<br />
changes in key press state or mouse button press state, recording the<br />
timestamp of any change. This is done first for 10 seconds on the<br />
keyboard, then for 10 seconds on the mouse.</p>
<p>Time difference between consecutive “state-change” samples is computed<br />
and plotted as a histogram.</p>
<p>At least on USB-HID devices - keyboards and mice connected via USB - you<br />
should see some characteristic distribution in the histograms. You’ll see<br />
that clusters of samples are spaced in even time intervals, typically<br />
separated by multiples of 8-10 msecs. This indicates that operating<br />
systems only update mouse and keyboard state at a sampling frequency of<br />
about 100 - 125 Hz and therefore measured mouse or keyboard response<br />
times will be quantized with at least that granularity.</p>
<p>There are more complex interactions, especially inside keyboards, that<br />
will increase latency and uncertainty about the timing of key presses<br />
beyond the 8 msecs granularity of the USB-HID scan cycle.</p>
<p>Be very cautious when using normal keyboards for reaction time<br />
measurements, or better use a dedicated response box.</p>
