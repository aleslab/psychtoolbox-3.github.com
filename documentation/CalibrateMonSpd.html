<p>Calling script for monitor calibration. Assumes<br />
you have <a href="CMCheckInit" class="uri">CMCheckInit</a>/<a href="MeasSpd" class="uri">MeasSpd</a> functions that initialize<br />
measurement hardware and return a measured spectral<br />
power distribution respectively.</p>
<p>NOTE (dhb, 8/19/12). This code is a bit dusty, as it is not<br />
being actively maintained. In particular, the PTB display<br />
control has evolved since this was last looked at carefully.<br />
In general, you want to calibrate through the same set of<br />
display calls you’ll use in your experiment. Below is some<br />
prose written by Mario Kleiner that describes how the PTB<br />
currently wants you to control and restore your clut. In<br />
an ideal world, this routine would be updated to match. But<br />
more generally, if you use this code you may want to modify<br />
to make sure it is displaying colors the same way you will in<br />
your experiments. The actual work is done in <a href="CalibrateMonDrvr" class="uri">CalibrateMonDrvr</a><br />
and <a href="CalibrateAmbDrvr" class="uri">CalibrateAmbDrvr</a> so that is where you would look.</p>
<pre><code>We have two functions for this. [LoadIdentityClut](LoadIdentityClut)() for loading an  
identity clut and configuring the GPU for identity pixel passthrough,  
and [RestoreCluts](RestoreCluts), which restores to the state before  
[LoadIdentityClut](LoadIdentityClut)(). I think &quot;[sca](sca)&quot; calls that, as well as showing the  
cursor and other cleanup actions.  

[LoadIdentityClut](LoadIdentityClut) is also automatically called by [PsychImaging](PsychImaging) etc. if  
the image processing pipeline is used for  
Bits++/Datapixx/Viewpixx,video attenuators etc.  

It is important to always use [LoadIdentityClut](LoadIdentityClut)() instead of self-made  
code. Many (most?) graphics cards on most operating systems have  
graphics driver bugs and hardware quirks which cause the self-made  
identity clut to actually not turn out to be an identity clut in the  
hardware. [LoadIdentityClut](LoadIdentityClut)() has heuristics to detect os/gpu combo  
and select an appropriately fudged lut to actually get an identity  
mapping. In case of new hardware with new quirks we should update  
that files detection logic to cope. Additionally there is  
[SaveIdentityClut](SaveIdentityClut)() to save a known good lut for automatic use with  
[LoadIdentityClut](LoadIdentityClut), overriding its choice. And there is  
[BitsPlusIdentityClutTest](BitsPlusIdentityClutTest) to test a Bits+ or Datapixx device  
thoroughly for problems and aid in fixing them. It is easy to get  
fooled into thinking you got it right, even when using a photometer,  
because some of the problems are subtle and not detectable without  
use of dynamic test patterns like in [BitsPlusIdentityClutTest](BitsPlusIdentityClutTest) with  
Mono++ mode, or special debug functionality as in the  
[DataPixx](DataPixx)/[ViewPixx](ViewPixx) devices.  

I use a [DataPixx](DataPixx) to test such stuff and PTB has builtin diagnostic to  
utilize that hardware to make sure that the video signal is really  
untampered.  

[LoadIdentityClut](LoadIdentityClut) also calls special functions in [Screen](Screen) that try to  
workaround or fix other hardware interference. E.g., in addition to  
cluts messing with pixel passthrough, there is also display dithering  
on any digital video output, and some new pre- and post-gamma  
corrections in latest generation hardware -- [Screen](Screen) can fix this for  
some cards on some operating systems, but only when used through  
[LoadIdentityClut](LoadIdentityClut).  

E.g., almost all AMD cards will cause trouble on OSX when the  
[PsychtoolboxKernelDriver](PsychtoolboxKernelDriver) and [LoadIdentityClut](LoadIdentityClut) etc. is not used,  
almost all [NVidia](NVidia) cards on OSX will cause trouble unless you use some  
special [NVidia](NVidia) kernel driver which is somewhere referenced on the  
Bits+ pages on our wiki. We have/need similar hacks on Windows, e.g.,  
[PsychGPUControl](PsychGPUControl)() for AMD cards. On Linux either PTB&#39;s low-level  
fixes apply or they are not neccessary.  

So the [CalibrateMonSpd](CalibrateMonSpd) etc. should be fixed to use  
[LoadIdentityClut](LoadIdentityClut)/[RestoreCluts](RestoreCluts), everything else is just begging for  
trouble.  </code></pre>
