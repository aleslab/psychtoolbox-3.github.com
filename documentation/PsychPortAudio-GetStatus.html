<h2 id="psychtoolbox-psychportaudio.mexdll-subfunction">[[Psychtoolbox]] › [[PsychPortAudio]].{mex*,dll} subfunction</h2>
<p>Returns ‘status’, a struct with status information about the current state of<br />
device ‘pahandle’.<br />
The struct contains the following fields:<br />
Active: Can be 1 if playback or recording is active, or 0 if playback/recording<br />
is stopped or not yet started.<br />
<a href="RequestedStartTime" class="uri">RequestedStartTime</a>: Is the requested start time of the audio stream after start<br />
of playback/recording. <a href="StartTime" class="uri">StartTime</a>: Is the real start time of the audio stream<br />
after start of playback/recording. If both, playback and recording are active<br />
(full-duplex mode), it is the start time of sound playback, ie an estimate of<br />
when the first sample hit the speakers. Same goes for pure playback.<br />
<a href="CaptureStartTime" class="uri">CaptureStartTime</a>: Start time of audio capture (if any is active) - an estimate<br />
of when the first sound sample was captured. In pure capture mode, this is<br />
nearly identical to <a href="StartTime" class="uri">StartTime</a>, but whenever playback is active, <a href="StartTime" class="uri">StartTime</a> and<br />
<a href="CaptureStartTime" class="uri">CaptureStartTime</a> will differ. <a href="CaptureStartTime" class="uri">CaptureStartTime</a> doesn’t take the user provided<br />
‘LatencyBias’ into account.<br />
<a href="RequestedStopTime" class="uri">RequestedStopTime</a>: The requested stop / sound offset time for playback of<br />
sounds, as selected via the ‘stopTime’ paramter in the ‘Start’,<br />
‘RescheduleStart’ or ‘Stop’ function. This will show a very large (~ infinite)<br />
value if no stop time has been sprecified.<br />
<a href="EstimatedStopTime" class="uri">EstimatedStopTime</a>: Estimated time when sound playback has stopped. This is an<br />
estimate of when exactly the last audio sample will leave the speaker. The value<br />
is zero as long as the estimate isn’t available. Due to the latency involved in<br />
sound playback, the value may become available a few msecs before or after<br />
actual sound offset.<br />
<a href="CurrentStreamTime" class="uri">CurrentStreamTime</a>: Estimate of when the most recently submitted sample will hit<br />
the speaker. This corresponds roughly to ‘PositionSecs’ below, but in absolute<br />
realtime.<br />
<a href="ElapsedOutSamples" class="uri">ElapsedOutSamples</a>: Total number of samples played out since start of playback.<br />
This count increments monotonically from start of playback to stop of playback.<br />
This denotes the absolute sample position that will hit the speaker at time<br />
‘CurrentStreamTime’.<br />
<a href="PositionSecs" class="uri">PositionSecs</a> is an estimate of the current stream playback position in seconds<br />
within the current playback loop of the current buffer. it’s not totally<br />
accurate, because it measures how much sound has been submitted to the sound<br />
system, not how much sound has left the speakers, i.e., it doesn’t take driver<br />
and hardware latency into account.<br />
<a href="SchedulePosition" class="uri">SchedulePosition</a>: Current position in a running schedule, if any.<br />
<a href="XRuns" class="uri">XRuns</a>: Number of dropouts due to buffer overrun or underrun conditions. This is<br />
not perfectly reliable, as the algorithm can miss some dropouts. Iow.: A<br />
non-zero or increasing value means that audio glitches during playback or<br />
capture happened, but a zero or constant value doesn’t mean everything was<br />
glitch-free, because some glitches can’t get reliably detected on some operating<br />
systems or audio hardware.<br />
<a href="TotalCalls" class="uri">TotalCalls</a>, <a href="TimeFailed" class="uri">TimeFailed</a> and <a href="BufferSize" class="uri">BufferSize</a> are only for debugging of <a href="PsychPortAudio" class="uri">PsychPortAudio</a><br />
itself.<br />
<a href="CPULoad" class="uri">CPULoad</a>: How much load does the playback engine impose on the CPU? Values can<br />
range from 0.0 = 0% to 1.0 for 100%. Values close to 1.0 indicate that your<br />
system can’t handle the load and timing glitches or sound glitches are likely.<br />
In such a case, try to reduce the load on your system.<br />
<a href="PredictedLatency" class="uri">PredictedLatency</a>: Is the latency in seconds of your driver+hardware combo. It<br />
tells you, how far ahead of time a sound device must be started ahead of the<br />
requested onset time via <a href="PsychPortAudio" class="uri">PsychPortAudio</a>(‘Start’…) to make sure it actually<br />
starts playing in time. High quality systems like Linux or <a href="MacOS" class="uri">MacOS</a>/X may allow<br />
values as low as 5 msecs or less on standard hardware. Other operating systems<br />
may require dozens or hundreds of milliseconds of headstart. Caution: In<br />
full-duplex mode, this value only refers to the latency on the sound output, not<br />
in the sound input! Also, this is just an estimate, not 100% reliable.<br />
<a href="LatencyBias" class="uri">LatencyBias</a>: Is an additional bias setting you can impose via<br />
<a href="PsychPortAudio" class="uri">PsychPortAudio</a>(‘LatencyBias’, pahandle, bias); in case our drivers estimate is a<br />
bit off. Allows fine-tuning.<br />
<a href="SampleRate" class="uri">SampleRate</a>: Is the sampling rate for playback/recording in samples per second<br />
(Hz).<br />
<a href="OutDeviceIndex" class="uri">OutDeviceIndex</a>: Is the deviceindex of the playback device, or -1 if not opened<br />
for playback. You can pass <a href="OutDeviceIndex" class="uri">OutDeviceIndex</a> to <a href="PsychPortAudio" class="uri">PsychPortAudio</a>(‘GetDevices’, [],<br />
<a href="OutDeviceIndex">OutDeviceIndex)</a>); to query information about the device.<br />
<a href="InDeviceIndex" class="uri">InDeviceIndex</a>: Is the deviceindex of the capture device, or -1 if not opened for<br />
capture.<br />
<a href="RecordedSecs" class="uri">RecordedSecs</a>: Is the total amount of recorded sound data (in seconds) since<br />
start of capture.<br />
<a href="ReadSecs" class="uri">ReadSecs</a>: Is the total amount of sound data (in seconds) that has been fetched<br />
from the internal buffer. The difference between <a href="RecordedSecs" class="uri">RecordedSecs</a> and <a href="ReadSecs" class="uri">ReadSecs</a> is<br />
the amount of recorded sound data pending for retrieval.</p>
