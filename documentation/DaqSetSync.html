USB-1208FS: Configure sync input/output.<br />
“<a href="DeviceIndex" class="uri">DeviceIndex</a>” is a small integer, the array index specifying which HID<br />
device in the array returned by <a href="PsychHID" class="uri">PsychHID</a>(‘Devices’) is interface<br />
0 of the desired USB-1208FS box.<br />
“type” is 0 for master, 1 for slave with continuous clock, or 2 for slave<br />
with gated clock.<br />
This command configures the sync signal. The sync signal may be used to<br />
synchronize the analog input scan of multiple devices. When multiple<br />
devices are to be used, one device is selected as the master and the rest<br />
as slaves. The sync signal of all devices must be wired together. The<br />
master will output a pulse every sample, and all of the devices will<br />
acquire their samples simultaneously. This may also be used to pace one<br />
or more devices from an external TTL/CMOS clock signal (max rate 50 kHz.)<br />
This may also be used with an external trigger; the external trigger<br />
signal should be brought to the master device, and all devices will begin<br />
sampling when the master is triggered. If a device is configured as a<br />
slave, it will not acquire data when given an <a href="AInScan" class="uri">AInScan</a> command until it<br />
detects a pulse on the sync input. If configured as a slave with a<br />
continuous clock, an additional sync pulse is required to set up the<br />
<a href="AInScan" class="uri">AInScan</a>. If configured as a slave with a gated clock the additional sync<br />
pulse is not required. However, if a sync pulse is received while the<br />
<a href="AInScan" class="uri">AInScan</a> setup is being performed by the device, improper operation may<br />
result. This is intended for use when synchronizing with another USB-1208FS,<br />
where the sync signal will not be present until the master device has<br />
been issued an <a href="AInScan" class="uri">AInScan</a> command. The device will switch the SYNC pin to<br />
the appropriate input/output state when this command is received.<br />
