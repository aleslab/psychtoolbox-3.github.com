## [[Psychtoolbox]] &#8250; [[Datapixx]].{mex*,dll} subfunction


Manually set the VESA stereo connector to output either Left or Right eye  
signal.  
Note that this function is here in case manual control is absolutely required;  
however, see [SetVideoVerticalStereo](SetVideoVerticalStereo) for a much more robust way to drive stereo  
goggles.
