<p>Apply an image processing operation to a texture ‘sourceTexture’ and store the<br />
processed result either in ‘targetTexture’ if provided, or in a new texture (if<br />
‘targetTexture’ is not provided). Use the data in the optional ‘sourceTexture2’<br />
as well if provided. This could be, e.g., a lookup table or a 2nd image for<br />
stereo processing. Return a handle ‘transtexid’ to the processed texture.<br />
The image processing operation is defined in the processing hook chain<br />
‘UserDefinedBlit’ of the proxy object ‘transformProxyPtr’. ‘specialFlags’<br />
optional flags to alter operation of this function:<br />
kPsychAssumeTextureNormalized - Assume source texture(s) are already in a<br />
normalized upright orientation. This can speed up processing, but it can lead to<br />
wrong results if the textures are not normalized and the imaging operation is<br />
non-isotropic - Use with care. A setting of specialFlags == 2 will ask to create<br />
or set the resulting ‘transtexid’ texture for high-precision drawing, see same<br />
setting in <a href="Screen" class="uri">Screen</a>(‘MakeTexture’) for explanation. Read ‘help<br />
PsychGLImageProcessing’ for more infos on how to use this function.</p>
