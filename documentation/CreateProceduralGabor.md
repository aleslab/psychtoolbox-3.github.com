## [Psychtoolbox](Psychtoolbox)[PsychGLImageProcessing](PsychGLImageProcessing)

[gaborid, gaborrect] = [CreateProceduralGabor](CreateProceduralGabor)(windowPtr, width, height [, nonSymmetric=0][, backgroundColorOffset =(0,0,0,0)][, disableNorm=0][, contrastPreMultiplicator=1][, validModulationRange=[-2,2]])  
  
Creates a procedural texture that allows to draw Gabor stimulus patches  
in a very fast and efficient manner on modern graphics hardware.  
  
This works on GPU's with support for the [OpenGL](OpenGL) shading language and  
vertex- and fragment shaders. See [ProceduralGaborDemo](ProceduralGaborDemo) and  
[ProceduralGarboriumDemo](ProceduralGarboriumDemo) for examples on how to use this function.  
[ProceduralGaborDemo](ProceduralGaborDemo) shows drawing of a single gabor and also allows to  
perform a speed benchmark and a correctness test to verify correct  
working and accuracy of this approach. [ProceduralGarboriumDemo](ProceduralGarboriumDemo) shows how  
to draw large numbers of gabor patches with different paramters in a very  
fast and efficient way.  
  
### Parameters and their meaning:  
  
'windowPtr' A handle to the onscreen window.  
'width' x 'height' The maximum size (in pixels) of the gabor. More  
precise, the size of the mathematical support of the gabor. Providing too  
small values here would 'cut off' peripheral parts or your gabor. Too big  
values don't hurt wrt. correctness or accuracy, they just hurt  
performance, ie. drawing speed. Use a reasonable size for your purpose.  
  
'nonSymmetric' Optional, defaults to zero. A non-zero value means that  
you intend to draw gabors whose gaussian hull is not perfectly circular  
symmetric, but a more general ellipsoid. The generated procedural texture  
will honor an additional 'spatial aspect ratio' parameter, at the expense  
of a higher computational effort and therefore slower drawing speed.  
  
'backgroundColorOffset' Optional, defaults to [0 0 0 0]. A RGBA offset  
color to add to the final RGBA colors of the drawn gabor, prior to  
drawing it.  
  
'disableNorm' Optional, defaults to 0. If set to a value of 1, the  
special multiplicative normalization term normf = 1/(sqrt(2\*pi) \* sc)  
will not be applied to the computed gabor. By default (setting 0), it  
will be applied. This term seems to be a reasonable normalization of the  
total amplitude of the gabor, but it is not part of the standard  
definition of a gabor. Therefore we allow to disable this normalization.  
  
'contrastPreMultiplicator' Optional, defaults to 1. This value is  
multiplied as a scaling factor to the requested contrast value.  
  
'validModulationRange' Optional, defaults to [-2, +2]. The range of gabor  
modulation values to which the gabr is clamped. As this can vary only in  
the range -1 to +1, the default setting of -2 <= x <= +2 means to not apply  
any restriction/clamping. If you'd set it to, e.g., [0, 2] then you would not  
allow negative values in the output gabor patch, only the positive "half-wave".  
This is important when adding colors to gabors, according to practitioners of  
the field.  
  
  
### Michelson contrast:  
  
If you use the normalized 0-1 color range and select 'modulateColor' below  
as unit values, e.g., modulateColor = [1 1 1 0], and leave globalAlpha out  
or set it to its 1.0 default, then the following seems to apply:  
  
If you set the 'disableNorm' parameter to 1 to disable the builtin normf  
normalization and then specify contrastPreMultiplicator = 0.5 then the  
per gabor 'contrast' value will correspond to what practitioners of the  
field usually understand to be the contrast value of a gabor. Specifically,  
assuming a 0.5 (=50%) gray background and a properly gamma corrected /  
linearized display, the 'contrast' value, as described below, that you  
pass to [Screen](Screen)('DrawTexture',...) will then allow to directly specify  
Michelson contrast: 'contrast' = (Imax - Imin) / (Imin + Imax)  
of course assuming isolated, non-superimposing gabors, so the Michelson  
contrast corresponds to the maxima and minima of the gabor patch under  
a suitable phase shift, where the minimum or maximum of the patch lies  
in the center of the patch.  
  
The function returns a procedural texture handle 'gaborid' that you can  
pass to the [Screen](Screen)('DrawTexture(s)', windowPtr, gaborid, ...) functions  
like any other texture handle. The 'gaborrect' is a rectangle which  
describes the size of the gabor support.  
  
### A typical invocation to draw a single gabor patch may look like this:  
  
[Screen](Screen)('DrawTexture', windowPtr, gaborid, [], dstRect, Angle, [], [],  
modulateColor, [], kPsychDontDoRotation, [phase+180, freq, sc,  
contrast, aspectratio, 0, 0, 0]);  
  
Draws the gabor 'gaborid' into window 'windowPtr', at position 'dstRect',  
or in the center if 'dstRect' is set to []. Make sure 'dstRect' has the  
size of 'gaborrect' to avoid spatial distortions! You could do, e.g.,  
dstRect = [OffsetRect](OffsetRect)(gaborrect, xc, yc) to place the gabor centered at  
screen position (xc,yc).  
  
The definition of the gabor mostly follows the definition of Wikipedia,  
but you can check the source code of [ProceduralGaborDemo](ProceduralGaborDemo) for a reference  
Matlab implementation which is exactly equivalent to what this routine  
does.  
  
Wikipedia's definition (better readable): http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabor\_filter  
See http://groups.yahoo.com/group/psychtoolbox/message/9174 for  
Psychtoolbox forum message 9174 with an in-dephs discussion of this  
function.  
  
  
'Angle' is the optional orientation angle in degrees (0-360), default is zero degrees.  
  
'modulateColor' is the base color of the gabor patch - it defaults to  
white, ie. the gabor has only luminance, but no color. If you'd set it to  
[255 0 0] you'd get a reddish gabor.  
  
'phase' is the phase of the gabors sine grating in degrees.  
  
'freq' is its spatial frequency in cycles per pixel.  
  
'sc' is the spatial constant of the gaussian hull function of the gabor, ie.  
the "sigma" value in the exponential function.  
  
'contrast' is the amplitude of your gabor in intensity units - A factor  
that is multiplied to the evaluated gabor equation before converting the  
value into a color value. 'contrast' may be a bit of a misleading term  
here...  
  
'aspectratio' Defines the aspect ratio of the hull of the gabor. This  
parameter is ignored if the 'nonSymmetric' flag hasn't been set to 1 when  
calling the [CreateProceduralGabor](CreateProceduralGabor)() function.  
  
Make sure to use the [Screen](Screen)('DrawTextures', ...); function properly,  
instead of the [Screen](Screen)('DrawTexture', ...); function, if you want to draw  
many different gabors simultaneously - this is much faster!
