<p>Compute fraction of photopigment bleached, given some measure of<br />
the intensity of light reaching the eye.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, the fundemantal measurements of the half-bleach<br />
constant for cones were made by Rushton and Henry (1968, Vision Reserch, 8, 617-631).<br />
This fact I learned from CVRL (http://www.cvrl.org/database/text/intros/introbleaches.htm).</p>
<p>I am pretty sure that the Rushton and Henry measurements were made for 560 nm<br />
light, and they give (see their Figure 2) a half-bleach constant of 4.3 log10 trolands (20,000 td).<br />
This number is also given in Boynton and Kaiser, Human Color Vision, 2nd edition,<br />
pp 211 and following.</p>
<p>It’s probably fine to compute bleaching for L and M cones given retinal illuminance<br />
in trolands, given that these are effects that matter over log10 units. But trolands<br />
are not going to help much for the S-cones. According to CVRL there aren’t good<br />
measurements for the half-bleaching constant for S cones because putting enough short-wavelength<br />
light onto the retina to bleach the S cones is not good for the eyes.</p>
<p>None-the-less, it seems nice to have this routine written so that it will return a number<br />
if you give it intensity either in trolands or in isomerizations/cone-sec. For 560 nm<br />
light and the CIE 10 deg fundamentals, I compute that 1 td is 137 isomerizations/cone-sec<br />
for L cones and 110 isomerizations/cone-sec for M cones. Take the weighted average value<br />
of (2*L + 1*M) = 128 and multiply by (10.^4.3) to get a half-bleach constant in<br />
isomerizations/cone-sec of 2.55e+06 (6.4 log10 isomerizations/cone-sec).<br />
[Computations done 6/2/14 using <a href="IsomerizationsInEyeDemo" class="uri">IsomerizationsInEyeDemo</a> and setting the fundamentals to ‘CIE10deg’ and wavelength to 560 nm<br />
by hand in the code. These are for the ‘Boynton’ source.]</p>
<p>[ASIDE: I used 10 deg fundamentals because I figure that Rushton’s measurements are based<br />
on a fairly large field. Because the macular pigment absorbs a fair amount of light,<br />
this matters. If I compute instead with 2-deg fundamentals, I get that 1 td is 23.7<br />
L cone isomerizations/cone-sec and 19.5 M cone isomerizations/cone-sec. These two<br />
numbers are ballpark consistent with Rodiek page 475 who gives 18.3 and 15.9 for a<br />
monochromatic 540 <a href="THz" class="uri">THz</a> light (555 nm)].</p>
<p>This routine will do the computation either on the basis of input in trolands or input<br />
in isomerization/cone-sec, using the appropirate constant as above. Note that the<br />
computation of isomerizations takes into account lens and macular pigment, while the<br />
troland value is the straight troland value. A second advantage of using units of<br />
isomerizations/cone-sec is that you can compute this for other regions of the visual<br />
field and presumably the numbers will be about right. You can also compute for S-cones<br />
on the assumption that the half-bleach constant is the same for S-cones as for L- and M-<br />
cones.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, the computations and analysis of bleaching do not take into account<br />
changes in isomerization rate that occur because of change in spectral sensitivity of cones<br />
with bleaching. That is, the measurements are simply of steady state pigment density and are<br />
modeled with a formula that assumes monochromatic light (see treatment in Boynton).</p>
<p>receptortype<br />
‘cones’ – computations for cones. [Default]</p>
<p>units<br />
‘troalands’ – input intensity in trolands. Note that the computation only makes<br />
sense for L and M cones if this is the input. This is photopic trolands<br />
if receptor type is ‘cones’. [Default]<br />
‘isomerizations’ – nominal isomerization rate in isomerizations/cone-sec, comptued<br />
taking into account pre-retinal absorption as well as nominal cone<br />
axial density. But not taking into account any pigment bleaching.<br />
