<h2 id="psychtoolbox-datapixx.mexdll-subfunction">[[Psychtoolbox]] › [[Datapixx]].{mex*,dll} subfunction</h2>
<p>Returns a struct containing the following DAC status information:<br />
-“scheduleRunning” is 1 if DAC waveform playback schedule is currently running,<br />
or 0 if stopped.<br />
-“scheduleOnset” is the programmed delay in seconds between <a href="StartDacSchedule" class="uri">StartDacSchedule</a><br />
execution, and the first DAC update.<br />
-“scheduleRate” is the rate at which the generated waveform is sampled.<br />
-“scheduleRateUnits” is the programmed units of scheduleRate:<br />
1: samples per second<br />
2: samples per video frame<br />
3: seconds per sample<br />
-“numChannels” is the number of DAC channels in the schedule and buffer.<br />
-“channelString” is a string with one status character per DAC channel. If the<br />
channel is not scheduled, the character is ‘-’; otherwise, the status character<br />
is the channel number (eg: ‘0–3’ means that channels 0 and 3 are scheduled).<br />
-“bufferBaseAddress” is the waveform data buffer base address within the<br />
Datapixx.<br />
-“bufferSize” is the number of bytes in the waveform data buffer.<br />
-“numBufferFrames” is the total number of samples which fit in the waveform data<br />
buffer specified in <a href="SetDacSchedule" class="uri">SetDacSchedule</a>.<br />
-“currentWriteFrame” is the buffer frame which will be written by the next<br />
streaming call to <a href="WriteDacBuffer" class="uri">WriteDacBuffer</a>.<br />
-“currentReadFrame” is the current buffer frame being read by the <a href="DACs" class="uri">DACs</a><br />
-“freeBufferFrames” = numBufferFrames - (currentWriteFrame - currentReadFrame).<br />
This is the maximum number of frames which can be written by the next call to<br />
<a href="WriteDacBuffer" class="uri">WriteDacBuffer</a> in streaming mode, without causing a streaming overflow.<br />
-“maxScheduleFrames”, if non-0, is the value of currentReadFrame which will<br />
automatically stop the schedule.<br />
-“numStreamUnderflows” is the number of <a href="WriteDacBuffer" class="uri">WriteDacBuffer</a> streaming underflows<br />
which have occurred since <a href="SetDacSchedule" class="uri">SetDacSchedule</a>. See <a href="WriteDacBuffer" class="uri">WriteDacBuffer</a> for details.<br />
-“numStreamOverflows” is the number of <a href="WriteDacBuffer" class="uri">WriteDacBuffer</a> streaming overflows which<br />
have occurred since <a href="SetDacSchedule" class="uri">SetDacSchedule</a>. See <a href="WriteDacBuffer" class="uri">WriteDacBuffer</a> for details.<br />
