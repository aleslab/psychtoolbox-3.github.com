<h2 id="psychtoolbox-screen.mexdll-subfunction">[[Psychtoolbox]] › [[Screen]].{mex*,dll} subfunction</h2>
<p>Query a list of all supported and valid display settings for screen<br />
“screenNumber” and display output “outputId”. If the optional ‘outputId’ is<br />
omitted, the unified settings of the screen are returned. Currently ‘outputId’<br />
is only honored on Linux, ignored on other systems.<br />
You can set your display to one of the supported combinations of settings via<br />
the <a href="Screen" class="uri">Screen</a>(‘Resolution’) command.<br />
Returns an array of structs “resolutions”, where each element in the array is a<br />
struct that describes one valid combination of resolution, color depth and<br />
refresh rate. Fields are self explanatory.<br />
Please note that unless you have good reason to do so, especially the color<br />
depth value “newPixelSize” should usually not be changed. Usually it is 32 bpp<br />
or 24 bpp. A setting of 16 bpp will disable alpha-blending and create<br />
drastically reduced color resolution of 5 bits per color channel. A setting of 8<br />
bpp is not supported at all on <a href="MacOS" class="uri">MacOS</a>/X and will create artifacts on all other<br />
systems. Use a size of 32 bpp even for clut animation. This function may not<br />
work on all MS-Windows setups, your mileage may vary.<br />
Please note that there are a couple of helper functions in the <a href="PsychOneLiners" class="uri">PsychOneLiners</a><br />
directory of Psychtoolbox which can simplify the task of switching resolutions.<br />
That functions are probably more convenient to use than the low-level <a href="Screen" class="uri">Screen</a><br />
functions for display settings…</p>
