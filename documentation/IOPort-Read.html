<p>Read data from device, specified by ‘handle’.<br />
Returned ‘data’ will be a row vector of read data bytes. ‘when’ will be a<br />
receive timestamp of when the data read was complete. ‘errmsg’ will be a human<br />
readable char string with an error message if any error occured, otherwise an<br />
empty string. The optional flag ‘blocking’ if set to 0 will ask the read<br />
function to not block, but return immediately: The read function will return<br />
whatever amount of data is currently available in the internal input queue, but<br />
at most ‘amount’ bytes if ‘amount’ is specified. If no data is available, it<br />
will return an empty matrix. This is the default.<br />
If ‘blocking’ is set to 1, you must specify the ‘amount’ of bytes to receive and<br />
the function will wait until that exact amount of data is available, then return<br />
it.Even in blocking mode, the function will return if no data becomes available<br />
within the time period specified by the configuration setting ‘ReadTimeout’ (see<br />
help for ‘OpenSerialPort’ for description). In some situations, the read<br />
function may return less data than requested, e.g., in specific error cases,<br />
where a read could only get partially satisfied.</p>
