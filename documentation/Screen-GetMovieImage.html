<p>Try to fetch a new texture image from movie object ‘moviePtr’ for visual<br />
playback/display in onscreen window ‘windowPtr’ and return a texture-handle<br />
‘texturePtr’ on successfull completion. ‘waitForImage’ If set to 1 (default),<br />
the function will wait until the image becomes available. If set to zero, the<br />
function will just poll for a new image. If none is ready, it will return a<br />
texturePtr of zero, or -1 if none will become ready because movie has reached<br />
its end and is not in loop mode.<br />
‘fortimeindex’ Don’t request the next image, but the image closest to time<br />
‘fortimeindex’ in seconds. ‘fortimeindex’ is only used if either playback is<br />
stopped in any case, or if forward playback is active while using the [<a href="GStreamer" class="uri">GStreamer</a>][(GStreamer)]((GStreamer))<br />
playback engine and fetching video frames asynchronously due to opening the<br />
movie with async flag set and sufficient buffering enabled on suitable movie<br />
file formats. In all other cases the ‘fortimeindex’ is silently ignored.<br />
Therefore you should always check if the timestamp of the returned movie frame<br />
actually satisfies the given ‘fortimeindex’ value if you choose to use<br />
‘fortimeindex’.<br />
The (optional) return value ‘timeindex’ contains the exact time when the<br />
returned image should be displayed wrt. to the start of the movie - a<br />
presentation timestamp.<br />
‘specialFlags’ (optional) encodes special requirements for the returned texture.<br />
A setting of 1 will try to create the texture as a GL_TEXTURE_2D texture.<br />
However this is not well supported with a setting of 2 (see below) or with use<br />
of a special ‘pixelFormat’ &gt; 4 in <a href="Screen" class="uri">Screen</a>(‘OpenMovie’). A setting of 2 will<br />
request that the texture is prepared for drawing it with highest possible<br />
spatial precision. See explanation of ‘specialFlags’ == 2 in<br />
<a href="Screen" class="uri">Screen</a>(‘MakeTexture’) for details. A ‘specialFlags’ == 8 will prevent automatic<br />
mipmap-generation for GL_TEXTURE_2D textures. A ‘specialflags’ == 32 will<br />
prevent closing the texture by a call to <a href="Screen" class="uri">Screen</a>(‘<a href="Close" class="uri">Close</a>’);<br />
‘specialFlags2’ (optional) More special flags: A setting of 1 tells the function<br />
to not return presentation timestamps in ‘timeindex’. This means that<br />
‘timeindex’ will be always returned as zero and that the built-in detector for<br />
skipped frames is disabled as well. This may (or may not) save a little bit of<br />
computation time during playback of very demanding movies on lower end systems,<br />
your mileage will vary, depending on many factors.<br />
A setting of 2 will skip creation and return of an actual video texture, instead<br />
a texture handle of 1 will be returned and no texture gets created. This is<br />
useful for fast fine-grained forward seeking in the movie by skipping single<br />
frames, and for benchmarking.</p>
