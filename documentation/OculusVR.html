<p><a href="OculusVR" class="uri">OculusVR</a> - How to setup Oculus VR head mounted displays.</p>
<p>Psychtoolbox supports Virtual Reality Head mounted displays,<br />
(VR-<a href="HMDs">HMDs)</a>) from Oculus VR LLC. Currently the Oculus Rift DK1<br />
and Oculus Rift DK2 are supported on the 64-Bit editions of<br />
GNU/Linux, Apple OSX and Microsoft Windows-7 and later, both<br />
under 64-Bit GNU/Octave (Linux and OSX) and 64-Bit Matlab (all<br />
systems).</p>
<p>In order to use such a HMD you need to install the Oculus VR<br />
runtime version 0.5.0.1 (-beta) for your operating system.<br />
This will not work with earlier or later versions of the runtime!</p>
<h3 id="the-runtime-can-be-downloaded-from">The runtime can be downloaded from:</h3>
<p>https://developer.oculus.com/downloads</p>
<p>You must select “Platform: PC” and the version as “0.5.0.1-beta”<br />
in the drop down menus. Then download the “Oculus Runtime for OSX”,<br />
“Oculus Runtime for Windows”, or “Oculus SDK for Linux (experimental)”<br />
and follow the installation and setup instructions contained in those<br />
installers / <a href="SDKs" class="uri">SDKs</a>.</p>
<p>Once installed according to instructions, and the HMD properly<br />
connected via HDMI video and the USB ports for headset and tracking<br />
camera (in case of Rift DK2), Psychtoolbox should detect the HMD and<br />
make use of it.</p>
<p>On Windows this works with “Extended Desktop” mode. On Linux it<br />
works on a regular dual display setup, but for best performance<br />
and timing you should set up a separate X-<a href="Screen" class="uri">Screen</a> for the Rift display.<br />
The Psychtoolbox/<a href="PsychHardware" class="uri">PsychHardware</a>/<a href="LinuxX11ExampleXorgConfs" class="uri">LinuxX11ExampleXorgConfs</a> subfolder<br />
contains example xorg.conf files for setting up dual-X-screen setups<br />
for Linux, with the GUI on X-<a href="Screen" class="uri">Screen</a> 0 and the Rift or other displays<br />
on X-<a href="Screen" class="uri">Screen</a> 1. You’ll need to adapt the example file to your specific<br />
setup. Running without a desktop compositor or desktop compositor<br />
disabled may give another performance boost on Linux with not so high<br />
end cards.</p>
<p>Our current experience shows that the Rift DK2 works best for more<br />
complex 3D VR scenes on Linux or Windows. Performance on OSX was much<br />
lower. With low complexity scenes all systems should be ok.</p>
<p>If you want to write portable code that makes use of VR headsets, and<br />
not only of the Oculus Rift, but also future headsets from Oculus or<br />
from other vendors, then use only the functions of the <a href="PsychVRHMD" class="uri">PsychVRHMD</a>()<br />
driver. It is expected to work also on future <a href="HMDs" class="uri">HMDs</a> and <a href="HMDs" class="uri">HMDs</a> of other<br />
vendors, once they become available. For use of Oculus Rift specific<br />
features you may need to use the <a href="PsychOculusVR" class="uri">PsychOculusVR</a>() driver directly, but<br />
for most usage scenarios that should not be neccessary.</p>
<p>Before use of the HMD, please read the “Health and safety instructions”<br />
carefully. They are included in the Psychtoolbox/<a href="PsychDocumentation" class="uri">PsychDocumentation</a>/<br />
folder as file Oculus_Health_and_Safety_Warnings.pdf. This file is<br />
provided as part of the Oculus SDK runtime and included here for<br />
your convenience.</p>
<p>The Oculus Rift runtime also comes with a setup tool named “<a href="RiftConfigUtil" class="uri">RiftConfigUtil</a>”<br />
that allows to adapt the rendering of stimuli to the properties of your<br />
subject, e.g. the interpupillary distance between both eyes.</p>
<h3 id="some-demos-to-get-you-started">Some demos to get you started:</h3>
<p><a href="VRHMDDemo" class="uri">VRHMDDemo</a> - Shows how to use a HMD as a regular monoscopic display<br />
monitor via <a href="VRHMDDemo1" class="uri">VRHMDDemo1</a>(0), or as a stereoscopic display<br />
via <a href="VRHMDDemo1" class="uri">VRHMDDemo1</a>(1) or <a href="VRHMDDemo" class="uri">VRHMDDemo</a>. As you can see, only one<br />
line of code is needed to setup a single HMD properly.<br />
Other than that, mono and stereo stimulus presentation is<br />
done like in any other mono or stereo Psychtoolbox script.</p>
<p>Various PTB stereo demos demonstrate use of <a href="HMDs" class="uri">HMDs</a>, e.g, <a href="ImagingStereoDemo" class="uri">ImagingStereoDemo</a>(103)<br />
for a random dot stereo display, <a href="ImagingStereoMoviePlayer" class="uri">ImagingStereoMoviePlayer</a>(moviefile, 103) for<br />
playback of stereoscopic movies.</p>
<p>The most interesting use is of course making use of the <a href="HMDs" class="uri">HMDs</a> head tracking<br />
to render complex 3D stimuli via <a href="OpenGL" class="uri">OpenGL</a> which can be navigated by the subjects<br />
head movements: Enabling an existing 3D stereoscopic script to use the HMD<br />
and make use of head tracking is a task that requires only a few more lines<br />
of code and can be accomplished in less than 15 minutes. The following demos<br />
demonstrate this use of the HMD: <a href="MorphDemo" class="uri">MorphDemo</a> for rendering a morphing 3D object,<br />
<a href="SuperShapeDemo" class="uri">SuperShapeDemo</a> for rendering a complex organic “<a href="SuperShape" class="uri">SuperShape</a>”, <a href="VRHMDDemo1" class="uri">VRHMDDemo1</a> for<br />
rendering of the spinning Utah teapot in 3D, with head movement and mouse<br />
control of observer location and looking direction. <a href="VRHMDDemo1" class="uri">VRHMDDemo1</a> also shows<br />
a few optimizations to get best performance for more complex scenes.</p>
<p>More such demos will follow in the future.</p>
<p>If you want to immerse your subjects in realistic 3D worlds, you can<br />
do this by use of the <a href="Horde3DForPsychtoolbox" class="uri">Horde3DForPsychtoolbox</a> toolbox which allows you<br />
to use the <a href="Horde3D" class="uri">Horde3D</a> graphics engine with Psychtoolbox. That toolbox also<br />
supports VR <a href="HMDs" class="uri">HMDs</a>, as demonstrated in the demo named “<a href="HordeVRHMDDemo1" class="uri">HordeVRHMDDemo1</a>”,<br />
which immerses you in a complex 3D VR scene and allows you to navigate<br />
it via mouse movements and head movements.</p>
<p>You can get the <a href="Horde3DForPsychtoolbox" class="uri">Horde3DForPsychtoolbox</a> addon toolkit from <a href="GitHub" class="uri">GitHub</a> as<br />
git checkout or as a downloadable zip file:</p>
<p>https://github.com/kleinerm/<a href="Horde3DForPsychtoolbox" class="uri">Horde3DForPsychtoolbox</a></p>
<p>More such demos for full VR environments as part of Horde will follow<br />
in the future.</p>
<p>Enjoy your immersion into new (virtual) worlds!</p>
