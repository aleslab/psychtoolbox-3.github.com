<p>The assumption underlying this routine is that the relative spectrum of a light<br />
is available, as well as the total power of the light passing through an aperture<br />
of known size. This is the situation in the apparatus we use in Sterling’s lab.<br />
The routine computes the irradiance (watts/um^2-wlinterval) from the relative spectrum<br />
(relative power, not relative quanta) and a measurement of the total power in watts,<br />
given the radiometer properties specified.</p>
<p>Radiometers do not typically have an ideal flat spectral response, and the actual<br />
spectral response is often provided as part of the instrument calibration. In addition,<br />
the instruments are typically calibrated to provide an accurate reading for one<br />
particular reference spectrum, which is also specified. This routine is set up<br />
to use this calibration information together with the known relative spectrum to<br />
provide a correct result. The radiometer properties may be passed in the radiometer<br />
structure. A default structure is set up that describes the radiometer used in<br />
the Sterling lab. This structure also describes the collecting area of the measurement<br />
configuration.</p>
<p>This routine could be easily modified to deal with a photometric head.</p>
<p>Input variables: relativeSpectrum is the relative power as a function of wavelength.<br />
relativeSpectrumS is the wavelength sampling information for the relativeSpectrum.<br />
readingInWatts is the total power measured.<br />
radiometer is a structure describing the radiometer. (default = Sterling Lab’s IL1400A).</p>

05/06/03 lyin Put wls into variable: lightSource<br />
05/06/03 lyin Correction for wavelength sampling interval<br />
06/12/03 lyin Change the way, variable being passed<br />
6/26/03 dhb Change some names, also compute power per wavelength interval, not per nm.<br />
6/30/03 dhb Lots more changes.<br />
