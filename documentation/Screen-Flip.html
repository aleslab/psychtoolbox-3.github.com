<p><a href="Flip" class="uri">Flip</a> front and back display surfaces in sync with vertical retrace and return<br />
completion timestamps.<br />
“windowPtr” is the id of the onscreen window whose content should be shown at<br />
flip time. “when” specifies when to flip: If set to zero (default), it will flip<br />
on the next possible video retrace. If set to a value when &gt; 0, it will flip at<br />
the first video retrace after system time ‘when’ has been reached. “dontclear”<br />
If set to 1, flip will not clear the framebuffer after <a href="Flip" class="uri">Flip</a> - this allows<br />
incremental drawing of stimuli. The default is zero, which will clear the<br />
framebuffer to background color after each flip. A value of 2 will prevent <a href="Flip" class="uri">Flip</a><br />
from doing anything to the framebuffer after flip. This leaves the job of<br />
setting up the buffer to you - the framebuffer is in an undefined state after<br />
flip. “dontsync” If set to zero (default), <a href="Flip" class="uri">Flip</a> will sync to the vertical<br />
retrace and will pause execution of your script until the <a href="Flip" class="uri">Flip</a> has happened. If<br />
set to 1, <a href="Flip" class="uri">Flip</a> will still synchronize stimulus onset to the vertical retrace,<br />
but will *not* wait for the flip to happen: <a href="Flip" class="uri">Flip</a> returns immediately and all<br />
returned timestamps are invalid. A value of 2 will cause <a href="Flip" class="uri">Flip</a> to show the<br />
stimulus *immediately* without waiting/syncing to the vertical retrace.<br />
“multiflip” defaults to zero: If set to a value greater than zero, <a href="Flip" class="uri">Flip</a> will<br />
flip *all* onscreen windows instead of just the specified one. This allows to<br />
synchronize stimulus onset on multiple displays, e.g., for multidisplay stereo<br />
setups or haploscopes. You need to (somehow) synchronize all attached displays<br />
for this to operate tear-free. <a href="Flip" class="uri">Flip</a> (optionally) returns a high-precision<br />
estimate of the system time (in seconds) when the actual flip has happened in<br />
the return argument ‘VBLTimestamp’. An estimate of Stimulus-onset time is<br />
returned in ‘StimulusOnsetTime’. Beampos is the position of the monitor scanning<br />
beam when the time measurement was taken (useful for correctness tests).<br />
<a href="FlipTimestamp" class="uri">FlipTimestamp</a> is a timestamp taken at the end of <a href="Flip" class="uri">Flip</a>’s execution. Use the<br />
difference between <a href="FlipTimestamp" class="uri">FlipTimestamp</a> and <a href="VBLTimestamp" class="uri">VBLTimestamp</a> to get an estimate of how long<br />
Flips execution takes. This is useful to get a feeling for the timing error if<br />
you try to sync script execution to the retrace, e.g., for triggering<br />
acquisition devices like EEG, fMRI, or for starting playback of a sound.<br />
“Missed” indicates if the requested presentation deadline for your stimulus has<br />
been missed. A negative value means that dead- lines have been satisfied.<br />
Positive values indicate a deadline-miss. The automatic detection of<br />
deadline-miss is not fool-proof - it can report false positives and also false<br />
negatives, although it should work fairly well with most experimental setups. If<br />
you are picky about timing, please use the provided timestamps or additional<br />
methods to exercise your own tests.</p>
