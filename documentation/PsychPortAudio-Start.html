<h2 id="psychtoolbox-psychportaudio.mexdll-subfunction">[[Psychtoolbox]] › [[PsychPortAudio]].{mex*,dll} subfunction</h2>
<p>Start a <a href="PortAudio" class="uri">PortAudio</a> audio device. The ‘pahandle’ is the handle of the device to<br />
start. Starting a device means: Start playback of output devices, start<br />
recording on capture device, do both on full duplex devices. ‘waitForStart’ if<br />
set to 1 will wait until device has really started, default is to continue<br />
immediately, ie. only schedule start of device. ‘when’ Requested time, when<br />
device should start. Defaults to zero, i.e. start immediately. If set to a<br />
non-zero system time, PTB will do its best to start the device at the requested<br />
time, but the accuracy of start depends on the operating system, audio hardware<br />
and system load. If ‘waitForStart’ is set to non-zero value, ie if PTB should<br />
wait for sound onset, then the optional return argument ‘startTime’ will contain<br />
an estimate of when the first audio sample hit the speakers, i.e., the real<br />
start time.<br />
Please note that the ‘when’ value always refers to playback, so it defines the<br />
starttime of playback. The start time of capture is related to the start time of<br />
playback in duplex mode, but it isn’t the same. In pure capture mode (without<br />
playback), ‘when’ will be ignored and capture always starts immediately. See the<br />
help for subfunction ‘GetStatus’ for more info on the meaning of the different<br />
timestamps.<br />
The ‘repetitions’ parameter defines how often the playback of the sound data<br />
should be repeated. A setting of zero will cause infinite repetitions, ie.,<br />
until manually stopped via the ‘Stop’ subfunction. A positive setting will cause<br />
the provided number of repetitions to happen. The default setting is 1, ie.,<br />
play exactly once, then stop. Fractional values are allowed, e.g, 1.5 for one<br />
and a half repetition.<br />
The optional parameter ‘stopTime’ allows to set a specific system time when<br />
sound playback should stop by itself at latest, regardless if the requested<br />
number of ‘repetitions’ has completed. PTB will do its best to stop sound at<br />
exactly that time, see comments about the ‘when’ parameter - The same mechanism<br />
is used, with the same restrictions.<br />
The optional parameter ‘resume’ if set to 1, allows to resume playback at the<br />
position it was last stopped, instead of starting at the beginning again. By<br />
default, playback starts at the beginning.</p>
