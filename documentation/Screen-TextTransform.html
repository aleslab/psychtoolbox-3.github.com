<p>Query or assign a 2D matrix defining a 2D affine transformation to apply to<br />
drawn text.<br />
‘windowPtr’ is the handle to the window for which the affine transform should be<br />
assigned or queried.<br />
‘newMatrix’ is an optional new 2x3 affine transformation matrix to assign.<br />
‘oldMatrix’ is the currently assigned 2x3 affine transformation matrix.<br />
The first 2 columns encode the 2x2 matrix, the 3rd column encodes tx, ty<br />
translation:<br />
[ xx, xy, tx ]<br />
[ yx, yy, ty ]</p>
<p>The affine transformation matrix defaults to an identity transformation matrix,<br />
in other words, no affine transformation is applied to a window by default.<br />
Not all text renderers do support application of affine transformations to text.<br />
If a renderer does not support affine transformations then the selected affine<br />
transformation is silently ignored during text drawing. As of February 2016 only<br />
the standard FTGL text renderer supports affine transforms in a meaningful way.<br />
The legacy Apple OSX <a href="CoreText" class="uri">CoreText</a> renderer only supports transforms in a somewhat<br />
broken and limited manner, at drastically reduced performance.<br />
The precision of text bounding boxes as returned by <a href="Screen" class="uri">Screen</a>(‘TextBounds’) may be<br />
impaired if non-identity affine transformations are applied. Text positioning<br />
may also be impaired. Different text renderers may provide inconsistent results<br />
wrt. text positioning and bounding boxes.<br />
In most cases it is better to use the general geometric stimulus post-processing<br />
of the Psychtoolbox image processing pipeline to apply geometric transformations<br />
to text and other visual content. This allows you to work in an easy to<br />
understand coordinate frame, with accurate text positioning, bounding boxes etc.<br />
and apply a consistent transformation to both text and other visual stimulus<br />
content as a post-processing step.</p>
